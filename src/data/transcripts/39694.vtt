I think the impulse to work with recycled materials...

00:14.285 --> 00:19.418
...started, growing up in a lower-class Canadian family.

00:20.227 --> 00:24.314
Part of my impulse is that the materials I was handed as a child...

00:24.549 --> 00:26.083
...were already used...

00:26.594 --> 00:30.131
...and I like that patina that something acquires over time...

00:30.266 --> 00:35.005
...that it becomes filled with sort of the gravitas, the dignitas,...

00:35.135 --> 00:36.574
...the evidence of its life.

00:37.095 --> 00:42.326
And so, what I try to do now is honor that patina that things collect.

00:54.715 --> 01:01.054
It's both respecting the fact that we're outgrowing the world.

01:01.488 --> 01:07.191
We're using up expendable resources and everybody should be encouraged...

01:07.303 --> 01:11.681
...to open their eyes and become aware of the vast potential...

01:12.042 --> 01:14.395
...that's in the everyday things we have around us.

01:25.870 --> 01:29.905
I think using things and awakening people's aesthetic...

01:29.977 --> 01:34.239
...to the fact that you can reuse, repurpose, redesign,...

01:34.475 --> 01:37.620
...reapply a lot of the things that we normally,...

01:38.221 --> 01:42.725
...that go into the trash recycling chain as art supplies,...

01:42.954 --> 01:49.243
...is a bit of a payback to everything I've been given...

01:49.383 --> 01:51.383
...as material benefit in this world.
