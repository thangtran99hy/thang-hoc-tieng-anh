Covid-19 is a disease caused by a virus,...

00:04.451 --> 00:07.402
...which belongs to the family of coronavirus.

00:08.537 --> 00:12.514
This virus is the one that caused a pandemic in 2020.

00:13.093 --> 00:17.740
A pandemic is a new disease that spreads all over the world...

00:18.094 --> 00:19.662
...and affects many people.

00:20.577 --> 00:26.056
So far, we have observed that this virus can spread very easily via vectors...

00:26.249 --> 00:29.716
...like objects we have touched through sneezing or coughing.

00:30.299 --> 00:34.541
This can cause many people to get sick during the process of transmission.

00:35.179 --> 00:37.831
That's why the disease has spread worldwide.

00:39.845 --> 00:44.603
As you know, the important thing now is to look after ourselves and others.

00:45.065 --> 00:47.339
That's why many measures have been taken.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.617
To avoid the spreading of the virus,...

00:49.835 --> 00:52.814
...it is advisable to follow some hygiene standards.

00:54.767 --> 00:59.135
Wash your hands very often or use hydroalcoholic gel.

00:59.863 --> 01:04.047
Did you know that this way the material that envelops the virus is broken?

01:04.448 --> 01:08.014
If this material is broken, the virus can't infect the cells.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.711
Be careful with the objects you touch...

01:11.962 --> 01:13.687
...and avoid touching your face.

01:15.731 --> 01:19.141
Keep a safe distance from others to protect yourself and them.

01:20.807 --> 01:24.864
If you use a mask, be careful not to touch it once you've put it on.

01:25.783 --> 01:28.258
The mask should cover your mouth and nose.

01:29.421 --> 01:31.573
Cough or sneeze into your elbow.

01:35.450 --> 01:39.393
Research is very important to be able to solve all our doubts.

01:39.736 --> 01:42.161
Moreover, we should thank all those people...

01:42.251 --> 01:45.534
...who are working and helping so that we can  get back to normal.

01:46.031 --> 01:48.515
Would you like to be a superhero?

01:49.283 --> 01:52.565
Follow all prevention measures to protect yourself.
