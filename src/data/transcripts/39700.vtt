Tokyo is a huge city full of energy and excitement.

00:08.287 --> 00:12.685
But when I was 22, I was diagnosed with a progressive muscular disease.

00:13.071 --> 00:15.737
I've been in a wheelchair since the age of 26.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.441
When my son was born, I wanted to stay positive for him.

00:22.663 --> 00:25.298
As a wheelchair user with the right information,...

00:25.414 --> 00:27.354
...you can still have fun as a family.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.845
So I started WheeLog!,...

00:31.283 --> 00:33.353
...a platform anyone can contribute to.

00:36.417 --> 00:39.995
You can use the app before you head out to check accessibility.

00:42.321 --> 00:45.563
When I started using a wheelchair, going out was a bit scary,...

00:46.318 --> 00:49.012
...but since using WheeLog!, I started to enjoy it.

00:50.487 --> 00:55.337
By continuing this work, I believe we can achieve a barrier-free world.
