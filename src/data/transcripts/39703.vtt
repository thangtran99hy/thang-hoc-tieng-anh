My major reasons for coming to Japan and choosing to take a gap year...

00:09.303 --> 00:12.763
...were basically that I wanted to decide what I wanted to do,...

00:12.881 --> 00:17.735
...whether I wanted to study medicine, and I'm really glad I took the time off...

00:17.941 --> 00:21.181
...and took the opportunity to experience the field...

00:21.331 --> 00:24.083
...before committing myself to studies.

00:25.057 --> 00:30.030
It's really important to realize how much you can get out of this experience-wise.

00:30.521 --> 00:36.563
It's just so exciting overseas and surrounded by different people,...

00:36.713 --> 00:40.447
...surrounded by a different culture, throwing myself in the deep end...

00:40.529 --> 00:41.975
...and trying something new.

00:42.491 --> 00:46.827
The hardest part is putting yourself out there and getting in there...

00:46.946 --> 00:50.929
...and doing the hard work because obviously, it's not easy all the time,...

00:51.537 --> 00:53.049
...but that's kind of a point.

00:53.227 --> 00:57.141
I've grown just in the last four months so much as a person.

00:57.551 --> 00:59.407
My confidence has skyrocketed...

00:59.767 --> 01:04.159
...and that's what being in Japan and doing this placement has taught me.
