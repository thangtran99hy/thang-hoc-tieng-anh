Volodymyr Zelensky came into power in April 2019...

00:04.549 --> 00:07.108
...with no political or military experience.

00:07.457 --> 00:10.870
The 44-year-old was previously only known for his acting career.

00:11.473 --> 00:14.543
The Ukrainian president now finds himself on the frontline...

00:14.996 --> 00:17.641
...of the most serious crisis in Europe since the Cold War.

00:19.291 --> 00:22.642
Our boys and girls, all defenders of Ukraine,...

00:22.770 --> 00:24.123
...did not allow the enemy...

00:24.238 --> 00:27.285
...to implement the operational plan of invasion on the first day.

00:27.780 --> 00:29.701
Ukrainians showed real heroism.

00:29.987 --> 00:32.177
The enemy was stopped in most directions.

00:34.731 --> 00:36.912
He now faces a formidable Russian force...

00:37.047 --> 00:38.785
...as President Vladimir Putin claims...

00:38.855 --> 00:42.543
...he is attempting to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine.

00:43.124 --> 00:46.860
Experts have claimed Putin's objective is to topple the regime in Kiev.

00:47.419 --> 00:50.183
The Ukrainian leader says his fate lies in the balance.

00:50.933 --> 00:53.133
Zelensky has appealed for help from NATO,...

00:53.645 --> 00:57.699
...but so far, he has only received military equipment and financial aid.
