Introducing a staple of Google office culture:...

00:03.007 --> 00:04.807
...Left Coast Chocolate Chip Cookies.

00:05.286 --> 00:09.645
So in 2007, Google's San Francisco office opened its first cafe,...

00:09.844 --> 00:12.085
...originally named the Left Coast Cafe.

00:12.828 --> 00:15.405
When lines would get long, a pastry chef at Google...

00:15.488 --> 00:19.034
...started baking the now famous Left Coast Chocolate Chip Cookies,...

00:19.257 --> 00:22.117
...which quickly became a fan favorite around the office.

00:23.155 --> 00:27.129
To this day, people will specifically visit our San Francisco offices...

00:27.434 --> 00:29.489
...just to have these amazing cookies.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.157
So good.
