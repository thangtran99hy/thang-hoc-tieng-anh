00:00.243 --> 00:01.806
This stuff is called a halo-halo...

00:01.975 --> 00:05.051
...and it might just be the most satisfying dessert in the world.

00:20.957 --> 00:23.594
Here we have all the ingredients for halo-halo,...

00:23.939 --> 00:25.431
...which is Tagalog for "mix-mix."

00:25.767 --> 00:29.175
It's a popular Filipino cold dessert that's not only popular,...

00:29.428 --> 00:31.190
...it's the dessert of the country.

00:31.403 --> 00:34.269
As Anthony Bourdain called it, "It's oddly beautiful."

00:34.546 --> 00:36.681
I don't even know what half of these ingredients are.

00:37.007 --> 00:39.140
It's made from shaved ice, condensed milk...

00:39.294 --> 00:42.494
...and lots of sweet toppings like jello, corn, fresh fruit,...

00:42.699 --> 00:46.733
...coconut, ube ice cream and leche flan, Filipino sweet custard.

00:46.978 --> 00:48.200
So how often do you eat it?

00:49.175 --> 00:50.047
How often?

00:50.161 --> 00:50.547
Once a week?

00:51.843 --> 00:53.527
No, it's thrice a week.

00:54.041 --> 00:54.894
It's a snow cone.

00:55.085 --> 00:56.319
It's an ice cream sundae.

00:56.487 --> 00:58.897
It's a sugary fruit cup that is so addicting,...

00:58.971 --> 01:00.339
...you cannot stop eating.

01:01.925 --> 01:04.762
Halo-halo's roots come from Manila in the 1920s.

01:04.889 --> 01:08.504
It was created as a spin-off of the Japanese dessert, "mitsumame..."

01:08.637 --> 01:11.586
...because at the time, the Philippines was under Japanese control.

01:11.867 --> 01:15.871
Today, every province, every city and every town in the Philippines...

01:16.059 --> 01:17.762
...has their own version of halo-halo.

01:17.943 --> 01:18.875
Secret sauce.

01:19.215 --> 01:20.361
That's the secret ingredient.

01:20.553 --> 01:23.116
Especially in the summertime when it's so hot.

01:23.419 --> 01:25.095
I know I tend to exaggerate sometimes,...

01:25.273 --> 01:28.677
...but halo-halo is truly one of the best desserts you can try...

01:28.840 --> 01:30.695
...and it's only here in the Philippines.
