00:00.830 --> 00:02.057
When the barrier goes up...

00:02.331 --> 00:05.177
...at this border crossing from Ukraine into Slovakia,...

00:05.807 --> 00:07.135
...families will separate.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.111
Husbands and fathers will go back.

00:17.247 --> 00:19.665
Women and children will go ahead to safety.

00:22.045 --> 00:25.897
When the barrier goes up, about 50 people at a time will get through.

00:26.481 --> 00:29.749
Security at a price: separation.

00:34.099 --> 00:36.313
That's why everything goes quiet...

00:39.254 --> 00:41.901
...just before the barrier goes up.

01:02.421 --> 01:05.893
We started the day on the Slovakian side, an EU member,...

01:06.139 --> 01:09.772
...along with all other members, have agreed to take in Ukrainian refugees...

01:10.138 --> 01:13.419
...for up to three years without them having to apply for asylum.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.199
Everyone was here.

01:17.598 --> 01:18.877
Slovakian president.

01:19.141 --> 01:20.836
People waiting for loved ones.
