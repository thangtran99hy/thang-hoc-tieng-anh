Refugees are ordinary people who live through extraordinary times.

00:10.246 --> 00:13.596
In the country they live in, conflict or persecution...

00:13.666 --> 00:14.914
...have put them at risk.

00:15.954 --> 00:19.508
They have no other choice but to flee and to leave their country...

00:19.694 --> 00:20.769
...to seek safety.

00:21.599 --> 00:23.434
This means leaving a lot behind,...

00:23.989 --> 00:26.891
...one of the hardest decisions a person can ever take.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.280
So what makes a person a refugee?

00:31.313 --> 00:34.357
Refugees are no longer in their own country...

00:34.759 --> 00:36.581
...and have crossed at least one border.

00:37.180 --> 00:40.858
Ongoing conflict may put them at risk if they return...

00:41.477 --> 00:43.695
...or they are at risk of persecution...

00:43.941 --> 00:47.920
...because of their nationality, race or sexual orientation...

00:48.365 --> 00:50.416
...or because they associate with a religion,...

00:50.697 --> 00:53.485
...a social group or a political opinion.

00:54.017 --> 00:58.177
Some get jailed or harmed physically or mentally.

00:59.710 --> 01:03.149
Refugees often flee with no more than the clothes on their back...

01:03.585 --> 01:06.171
...and leave behind their everyday life.
