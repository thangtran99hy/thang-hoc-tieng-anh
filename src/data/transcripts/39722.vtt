00:00.355 --> 00:01.554
On February 24th,...

00:01.698 --> 00:05.580
...just hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation,...

00:05.891 --> 00:07.853
...bombing by the Russian military began,...

00:08.162 --> 00:10.407
...followed by thousands of troops entering Ukraine.

00:11.164 --> 00:13.191
So what led to this catastrophic invasion?

00:13.747 --> 00:17.644
Since Vladimir Putin's ascent to power in 2000, according to U.S. officials,...

00:17.815 --> 00:21.332
...his end goal for decades has been a restoration of the former Soviet Union,...

00:21.865 --> 00:24.417
...including now independent countries like Ukraine.

00:24.942 --> 00:28.073
NATO, an alliance of 30 European and North American countries...

00:28.183 --> 00:29.571
...established after World War II,...

00:29.679 --> 00:32.230
...has been an effective deterrent against international aggression,...

00:32.709 --> 00:35.631
...but also an informal adversary to Putin's long-term plans.

00:36.255 --> 00:39.140
Ukraine sits on the border between Russia and many NATO countries...

00:39.279 --> 00:40.823
...and has made overtures in the past decade...

00:40.923 --> 00:43.535
...to align itself closer with the European Union and NATO,...

00:43.717 --> 00:45.649
...creating tension between Russia and Ukraine.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.787
The conflict reached a critical point in 2014...

00:49.073 --> 00:52.128
...when pro-Moscow Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych,...

00:52.355 --> 00:54.999
...rejected an association agreement with the European Union.

00:55.122 --> 00:58.168
Following that controversial decision, massive protests began...

00:58.520 --> 01:01.135
...and the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove him from office...

01:01.222 --> 01:02.981
...while efforts to join NATO resumed.

01:03.335 --> 01:06.871
In response, Russia invaded and effectively annexed Crimea,...

01:07.023 --> 01:09.883
...an ethnically Russian territory of Ukraine on the Black Sea.

01:10.211 --> 01:14.589
To the east, Ukrainian separatists began fighting for control of additional regions...

01:14.707 --> 01:16.883
...supported by Russian arms and supplies.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.337
And while a peace agreement later in 2014...

01:19.463 --> 01:22.573
...largely ended full-scale fighting among Ukrainians and rebel forces,...

01:22.923 --> 01:25.279
...it allowed separatists to create their own police force...

01:25.363 --> 01:27.073
...and keep political influence in the region,...

01:27.413 --> 01:29.891
...effectively keeping pro-Moscow rebels in power.

01:30.554 --> 01:34.188
Recently in the past weeks though, Putin formally rejected that peace agreement...

01:34.355 --> 01:38.361
...and recognized these regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

01:41.229 --> 01:45.111
No one knows exactly why Putin has escalated the conflict to full-scale invasion now,...

01:45.426 --> 01:49.463
...but economic sanctions from multiple countries including halting Nord Stream 2,...

01:49.580 --> 01:52.688
...a crucial gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and the rest of Europe,...

01:52.945 --> 01:54.659
...has not deterred the leader's aggression.

01:55.373 --> 01:59.353
Putin has strongly denounced Ukraine's attempts to join NATO in recent years...

01:59.698 --> 02:03.395
...and considers their inclusion a red line in diplomatic discussions...

02:03.848 --> 02:06.527
...and has described Russians and Ukrainians as one people...

02:06.637 --> 02:10.395
...and questioned Ukraine's right to exist as an independent country.
