00:03.973 --> 00:06.967
Refugees are people who flee their country...

00:07.167 --> 00:09.425
...to escape conflict or persecution.

00:10.384 --> 00:12.645
But where do they go to find safety?

00:13.732 --> 00:16.102
Most refugees can be found in countries...

00:16.171 --> 00:18.195
...neighboring the country they have fled from.

00:18.915 --> 00:22.125
Many want to stay close to family and friends...

00:22.652 --> 00:24.497
...and hope to soon return home.

00:25.455 --> 00:29.390
In many cases, it takes a long time until this is possible,...

00:29.610 --> 00:33.221
...so they continue to live as refugees for many years.

00:33.557 --> 00:37.988
The majority of refugees live in urban areas in their host country.

00:38.255 --> 00:42.102
They rent in towns and cities and try to provide for their families.

00:42.676 --> 00:46.013
Others live in refugee camps or improvised shelters...

00:46.185 --> 00:49.431
...where living conditions can be at least equally challenging.

00:51.070 --> 00:55.322
Some refugees have to stay in camps for years or even decades.

00:56.413 --> 00:59.943
Today, most refugees can be found in Africa...

01:00.261 --> 01:03.321
...and regions like the Middle East and South Asia.

01:04.353 --> 01:08.829
Only a relatively small number can be found in industrialized regions...

01:09.012 --> 01:12.971
...like North America, Europe and Australia.

01:13.901 --> 01:18.121
The great majority of refugees, nearly nine out of ten...

01:18.474 --> 01:19.982
...live in developing regions.

01:20.897 --> 01:24.131
This means that some of poorest countries in the world...

01:24.345 --> 01:27.645
...that already face economic and social challenges of their own...

01:28.017 --> 01:30.219
...host huge refugee populations.
