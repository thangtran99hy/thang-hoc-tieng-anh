00:01.585 --> 00:03.183
For me, it means to bring a different perspective...

00:03.342 --> 00:04.656
...and empower women in business.

00:04.815 --> 00:06.364
For me, to be a woman in business,...

00:06.509 --> 00:09.699
...it means to enter spaces where you can make change...

00:09.853 --> 00:11.420
...whether that be big or small...

00:11.535 --> 00:13.943
...and just know by being there and raising your voice,...

00:14.040 --> 00:17.003
...you're playing a key role in breaking those inequitable systems.

00:17.098 --> 00:19.547
And it also means stepping into your own personal power...

00:19.643 --> 00:21.232
...in creating space for others...

00:21.411 --> 00:23.515
...who come from marginalized communities to do the same.

00:23.735 --> 00:27.325
For me, being a woman in business is leading with the example,...

00:27.775 --> 00:29.855
...trying my best no matter the scenario...

00:30.251 --> 00:31.949
...and always learning and improving.

00:32.174 --> 00:33.237
Being a really good role model...

00:33.318 --> 00:35.129
...and showing other women what they are capable of.

00:35.311 --> 00:37.779
I've been really lucky to have great mentors in my life...

00:37.943 --> 00:39.134
...and so I want to pay it forward...

00:39.457 --> 00:42.291
...and make sure I can empower other women in positions in the future.
