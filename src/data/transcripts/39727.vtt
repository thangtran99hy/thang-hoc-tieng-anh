Hey Ellie!

00:05.898 --> 00:07.055
Hi Auntie.

00:07.988 --> 00:08.797
What's wrong, Ellie?

00:08.903 --> 00:12.891
Alex and Lyndon have this really cool toy.

00:12.981 --> 00:14.332
Oh, the building blocks, Ellie?

00:14.424 --> 00:15.192
Yeah!

00:15.274 --> 00:16.229
They didn't let you play?

00:16.305 --> 00:18.434
No, they didn't let me play.

00:18.649 --> 00:20.214
Oh, I'm sorry Ellie.

00:20.691 --> 00:23.237
Since you're doing so well in school, you deserve a reward.

00:23.677 --> 00:24.415
Really Auntie?

00:24.679 --> 00:25.377
Thank you!

00:25.475 --> 00:26.794
Alright, I'll be right back.

00:29.006 --> 00:30.695
Ellie, can you clean your room a little bit?

00:30.804 --> 00:31.965
Okay Auntie, I will.

00:38.782 --> 00:40.045
I'm back!

00:40.267 --> 00:41.454
Hi Auntie!

00:41.554 --> 00:42.367
Look what I got you.

00:42.471 --> 00:46.767
Ball pit? Wow, this is so cool, Auntie.

00:46.957 --> 00:48.825
Ellie, this is just half of the toy.

00:48.957 --> 00:49.862
What?

00:49.953 --> 00:51.174
Come on Ellie, follow me.

00:52.331 --> 00:53.483
Wow!

00:57.275 --> 00:58.896
This is so awesome!

00:59.015 --> 01:01.508
You worked so hard in school, you deserve it, Ellie.

01:01.619 --> 01:02.335
Are you ready, Ellie?

01:02.528 --> 01:03.018
Yeah!

01:05.694 --> 01:06.639
Go Ellie!

01:08.619 --> 01:10.701
She looks like she's having so much fun.

01:21.097 --> 01:23.960
Wow! This is fun, Ellie.

01:25.435 --> 01:27.069
I'm having so much fun.

01:30.109 --> 01:31.842
Ellie has all these cool toys?

01:32.079 --> 01:32.642
Yeah.

01:32.961 --> 01:35.463
Hey Alex, Lyndon, come and play.

01:35.658 --> 01:36.935
You want us to play with you?

01:37.039 --> 01:39.086
Really? But we didn't share our toys.

01:39.171 --> 01:40.085
Sharing is caring!

01:41.889 --> 01:43.773
So sharing is caring?

01:44.690 --> 01:45.876
That's a great idea.

01:45.974 --> 01:46.782
We'll be right back!

01:46.919 --> 01:47.775
Okay.

01:49.149 --> 01:50.606
This is an awesome boat.

01:51.442 --> 01:52.729
Sharing is caring!

01:52.812 --> 01:54.801
Thanks for letting us play with you, Ellie.

01:54.900 --> 01:56.728
Yeah and sorry we didn't let you play with us.

01:56.807 --> 01:57.667
Good job, guys.

01:57.790 --> 01:58.941
We learned a valuable lesson.

01:59.038 --> 02:00.019
Sharing is caring.

02:00.152 --> 02:01.353
Bye!
