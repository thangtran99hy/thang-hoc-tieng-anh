This is what Japan's leadership looks like.

00:04.645 --> 00:07.431
The ruling party now wants more women at key meetings...

00:07.624 --> 00:09.270
...as long as they don't talk.

00:09.853 --> 00:11.171
The Liberal Democratic Party...

00:11.247 --> 00:14.427
...proposed allowing five female lawmakers to join its nearly...

00:14.525 --> 00:17.958
...all-male board meetings, but only as observers.

00:19.953 --> 00:23.338
Toshihiro Nikai, the party's 82-year-old secretary general,...

00:23.578 --> 00:25.315
...said it's important for women to, quote...

00:25.483 --> 00:28.679
..."understand what kind of political discussions are happening,...

00:28.875 --> 00:31.048
...so it's about letting them take a look."

00:31.677 --> 00:32.859
Outrage ensued.

00:33.175 --> 00:36.819
Social media users decry the LDP proposal as tone-deaf...

00:36.917 --> 00:41.395
...and yet another example of deep-rooted sexism in Japanese society.

00:42.123 --> 00:44.464
Japanese writer Mieko Kawakami tweeted that...

00:44.557 --> 00:48.883
..."Women are treated as second-class citizens forever here in Japan."

00:49.617 --> 00:52.269
Others mocked the idea as a "field trip" for women.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.560
The proposal comes in response to criticism...

00:55.628 --> 00:58.213
...that the LDP's board is dominated by men.

00:58.586 --> 01:03.431
On February 15th, Tomomi Inada, who was Japan's second female defense minister,...

01:03.778 --> 01:05.457
...wrote this letter to Nikai...

01:05.735 --> 01:08.887
...asking for more representation of female lawmakers.

01:12.959 --> 01:15.166
Japan is a democracy without women.

01:15.405 --> 01:17.720
The perception that politics should be done by men...

01:17.806 --> 01:19.837
...still widely exists here in Japan...

01:20.160 --> 01:23.591
...and the perception that good women are those who behave properly...

01:23.663 --> 01:27.026
...and don't push themselves forward also still exists.
