The World Economic Forum calls Japan's gender gap...

00:02.734 --> 00:05.747
...by far the largest among all advanced economies,...

00:06.069 --> 00:10.618
...ranking it 144th place on its political empowerment index...

00:10.846 --> 00:12.486
...between Qatar and Iran.

00:13.516 --> 00:17.503
Fewer than 10% of Japan's House of Representatives are women,...

00:17.854 --> 00:21.148
...just 46 out of 465 members.

00:21.821 --> 00:26.745
Inada says Japan is still 20 years behind other developed countries in gender equality...

00:27.038 --> 00:29.416
...and that more drastic changes needed.

00:30.001 --> 00:32.161
I think we should introduce a quota system.

00:32.438 --> 00:36.199
We are proposing to make 30% of candidates for elections female.

00:36.581 --> 00:38.988
Without doing this, I don't think we will have change...

00:39.073 --> 00:41.701
...for even another 10 or 20 years.
