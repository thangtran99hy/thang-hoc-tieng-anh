Hey bosses, it's Winnie from Asian Boss.

00:02.845 --> 00:03.815
When it comes to Japan,...

00:03.942 --> 00:07.338
...one of the most common social issues that you'd associate with the country...

00:07.425 --> 00:09.644
...is probably its overwork culture.

00:10.405 --> 00:12.462
But according to the Japanese labor law,...

00:12.760 --> 00:16.828
...only 8 hours a day which equates to 40 hours a week is allowed.

00:17.296 --> 00:22.726
So, does the perception of overwork or death due to overwork still hold true in 2021?

00:23.320 --> 00:25.778
How many hours do Japanese actually work?

00:26.529 --> 00:29.513
This is the Asian Boss street poll, and let's go check it out.

00:41.656 --> 00:43.337
So, here you have the results, guys.

00:43.692 --> 00:45.597
Unfortunately, in the past six hours...

00:45.703 --> 00:49.369
...we weren't able to get 100 participants to do our street poll.

00:49.731 --> 00:51.704
However, according to the result here,...

00:51.817 --> 00:55.887
...you can see that around 60% of our participants...

00:56.005 --> 00:58.989
...actually work for 40 to 60 hours per week,...

00:59.511 --> 01:04.883
...and about 25% work for 60 to 80 hours per week,...

01:05.010 --> 01:08.659
...which is a lot higher than the 40 hours regulated by law,...

01:08.911 --> 01:11.964
...and you can see that there is a small portion of people...

01:12.082 --> 01:13.871
...who actually work more than 80 hours.

01:14.197 --> 01:18.605
Of course, this differs from industry and differs by age.

01:19.381 --> 01:25.537
It does not necessarily represent the overall Japanese working population.

01:25.870 --> 01:30.000
However, we still hope that you find this quite interesting and informative.
