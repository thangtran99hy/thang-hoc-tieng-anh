Japan is one of the few developed countries...

00:02.718 --> 00:05.038
...where the #MeToo movement has yet to take hold.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.588
Women play a key role in the world's third biggest economy,...

00:08.871 --> 00:11.401
...but they must contend with a large gender pay gap.

00:11.965 --> 00:15.779
In addition, women occupy only about 10% of senior positions...

00:15.878 --> 00:17.617
...in the public and private sectors.

00:18.464 --> 00:20.463
Political representation is poor.

00:20.940 --> 00:24.202
Only three members of the current 20-member cabinet are women.

00:25.591 --> 00:28.427
Just five of the 48 councilors here are women.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.107
One of them, the independent council of Yuka Ogata,...

00:32.435 --> 00:36.087
...is shaking up Kumamoto's male-dominated political establishment.

00:36.341 --> 00:39.273
In 2017, Ogata caused a stir...

00:39.343 --> 00:42.129
...when she took her newborn son into the assembly chamber.

00:42.763 --> 00:46.191
She'd intended to highlight the lack of support for working mothers,...

00:46.840 --> 00:48.931
...but her gesture angered her male colleagues...

00:49.106 --> 00:50.891
...and she was ordered to leave the chamber.

00:52.455 --> 00:55.703
I felt I have all the right to be in the chamber.

00:56.103 --> 01:00.957
Nobody has the right to expel me because I'm representing people.

01:02.971 --> 01:07.235
So I was really trying to hold my ground...

01:07.356 --> 01:11.491
...no matter how many times they tell me to leave with my baby.

01:11.910 --> 01:14.135
Two years have passed since Ogata's protest,...

01:14.663 --> 01:16.507
...but the local assembly has still not opened...

01:16.609 --> 01:18.727
...child care facilities on its premises.

01:18.966 --> 01:21.895
That said, Ogata has become the most visible champion...

01:21.961 --> 01:23.464
...of women's rights in the city.
