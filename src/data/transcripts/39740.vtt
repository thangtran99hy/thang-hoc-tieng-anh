00:01.225 --> 00:04.829
In 2011, the Great Tohoku Earthquake occurred.

00:05.603 --> 00:09.083
When I saw the destruction of the city, my heart sank.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.787
In spite of all of this,...

00:13.050 --> 00:16.189
...I was drawn to the resilience and strength of the local people.

00:17.145 --> 00:20.160
I left the big city for the nature of this village:...

00:20.441 --> 00:23.549
...the ocean, the mountains, and rivers.

00:25.138 --> 00:28.525
Inspired by the locals, we began a revitalization project...

00:28.849 --> 00:32.297
...to restore an old traditional Japanese house in the village.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.970
I also began farming indigo and creating sustainable good using aizome,...

00:37.299 --> 00:39.881
...a traditional organic Japanese dyeing technique.

00:40.805 --> 00:43.820
Being a mother and an entrepreneur is not easy,...

00:44.512 --> 00:46.660
...but the women here support each other.

00:48.255 --> 00:51.164
As a community, we are developing many projects together,...

00:51.356 --> 00:53.317
...with the hope of revitalizing our city...

00:53.513 --> 00:56.187
...and shaping a bright future for Minamisanriku.
