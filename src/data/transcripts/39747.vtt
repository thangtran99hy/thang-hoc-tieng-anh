I'm speaking to 41-year-old Fumiyoshi Shimizu...

00:04.767 --> 00:10.383
...who has personally experienced how overwork can severely affect mental health.

00:12.229 --> 00:16.958
Fourteen years ago, Shimizu-san was one of the 800,000 workers...

00:17.037 --> 00:20.393
...employed at convenience store chains across Japan.

00:21.404 --> 00:25.720
Because of punishing schedules and general labor shortages across Japan,...

00:26.245 --> 00:29.105
...24-hour stores are difficult to staff.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.115
Shimizu-san's dedication to his job reminds me of a pervasive Japanese phrase,...

00:36.217 --> 00:39.541
..."ganbaru" or "to persevere through hardship."

00:40.585 --> 00:43.872
But persevering on just three hours of sleep a day...

00:44.165 --> 00:47.335
...puts the body and the brain under enormous stress.

00:48.377 --> 00:52.413
A year into the job, Shimizu-san was diagnosed with depression,...

00:52.826 --> 00:55.996
...but he ignored his doctor's advice to take a break.

00:56.661 --> 01:01.751
For better or for worse, there's a deeply ingrained mentality in Japanese society...

01:02.047 --> 01:05.217
...that the group comes before the needs of the individual.

01:06.411 --> 01:09.086
Because Shimizu-san was put on unpaid leave,...

01:09.396 --> 01:13.031
...he asked the company to compensate him for his overtime hours.

01:13.324 --> 01:18.248
Shimizu-san took the company to court and won.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.886
Shimizu-san was awarded 15,000 US dollars in compensation for his overtime hours...

01:32.219 --> 01:35.111
...and for the damage the work had done to his health,...

01:35.799 --> 01:37.754
...a rare outcome in Japan.
