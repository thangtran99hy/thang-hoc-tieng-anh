00:00.821 --> 00:05.756
Drought has destroyed the harvest in southern Madagascar for four straight years...

00:06.745 --> 00:10.347
...and sandstorms made it next to impossible to replant the fields.

00:11.352 --> 00:14.708
Bole has three children as well as two orphans she took in.

00:15.837 --> 00:18.326
Every day is a fight for survival.

00:23.079 --> 00:24.318
I trust in God.

00:25.018 --> 00:28.591
Today, we have absolutely nothing to eat except cactus flowers,...

00:28.804 --> 00:30.234
...which we are trying to clean.

00:31.159 --> 00:35.165
The children here, their mother died and so did my husband.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.578
The World Food Programme says...

00:40.651 --> 00:45.059
...acute malnutrition among children under five has doubled in just five months.

00:45.961 --> 00:49.212
In one district, a quarter of all children are malnourished.

00:50.225 --> 00:53.488
All told, more than one million people need help.

00:54.949 --> 00:57.964
Northern Ethiopia has also long depended on aid.

00:58.809 --> 01:02.227
Last year, there was a plague of locusts, then the war.

01:03.005 --> 01:05.358
More and more people require assistance,...

01:06.571 --> 01:10.771
...but many areas in the interior away from the cities are inaccessible.

01:12.474 --> 01:16.686
People have lost their assets and money.

01:17.723 --> 01:20.319
So people are still in a very vulnerable situation...

01:20.400 --> 01:25.613
...trying to manage with the farmers, potentially with a few stocks that they had.

01:26.781 --> 01:29.269
We know that people are not having seeds to plant...

01:29.392 --> 01:33.627
...or they potentially might be missing another harvest.

01:35.024 --> 01:37.265
If the next harvest is also lost,...

01:37.535 --> 01:41.169
...people like this farming couple will also have to turn to the aid agencies.

01:41.730 --> 01:44.524
Across Africa, the number of those forced to flee drought,...

01:44.757 --> 01:47.245
...violence and climate change, is on the rise.
