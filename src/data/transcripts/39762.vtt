I got married two years ago and now I have twins.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.717
Wow! Twins?

00:05.171 --> 00:06.754
Are they boys or girls?

00:07.109 --> 00:08.371
They are a boy and a girl.

00:08.774 --> 00:09.843
How old are they?

00:10.008 --> 00:11.567
They are six months now.

00:11.807 --> 00:13.814
Oh, I want to see them.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.893
They must be very cute.

00:16.191 --> 00:18.213
Yes, they are just lovely.

00:20.223 --> 00:23.194
Hey, is that a new version of Game of Kings?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.247
You can't buy that here.

00:26.564 --> 00:27.476
Where did you get it?

00:27.955 --> 00:28.625
From my brother.

00:30.161 --> 00:31.230
He sent it to me.

00:32.822 --> 00:33.533
What?

00:34.102 --> 00:34.739
Charlie?

00:35.174 --> 00:38.087
No, my other brother, Rob.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.177
He lives in the States, in New York.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.365
Really?

00:42.933 --> 00:44.361
I didn't know you had another brother.
