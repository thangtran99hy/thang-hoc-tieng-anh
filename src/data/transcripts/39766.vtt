00:02.857 --> 00:05.714
...will be leading South Korea for the next five years.

00:05.944 --> 00:09.183
Yoon was elected the country's new president early Thursday,...

00:09.384 --> 00:12.894
...capping off one of the closest presidential races in history.

00:14.585 --> 00:16.681
According to the National Election Commission,...

00:16.770 --> 00:20.051

00:20.171 --> 00:25.634
...against his rival Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic Party's 47.8%

00:26.523 --> 00:29.317
Yoon's gap with Lee was less than one percentage point,...

00:29.476 --> 00:32.951

00:43.646 --> 00:46.194
...who pursued high-profile corruption cases.

00:46.519 --> 00:50.016
By riding a wave of public anger at the Moon Jae-in administration,...

00:50.132 --> 00:53.388
...Yoon appealed to many voters who wanted a change of government.

00:53.725 --> 00:57.782
The surprise last-minute merger with Ahn Cheol-soo from the minor People's Party...

00:57.919 --> 01:00.262
...created momentum for Yoon's victory.

01:00.544 --> 01:03.246
The two will now work on merging the two parties.

01:03.879 --> 01:06.877
Yoon's election pledges included improving the economy,...

01:06.998 --> 01:11.187
...tightening the alliance with the U.S. and taking a harder line with North Korea.

01:11.425 --> 01:13.779

01:18.203 --> 01:23.324
...and establishing a specialized institution to reform regulations to create jobs.

01:23.607 --> 01:27.032
But from Ukraine crisis to stalled nuclear talks with the North,...

01:27.295 --> 01:31.673
...Yoon also has a lot of global issues to deal with once he takes the office.
