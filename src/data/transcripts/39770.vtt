00:00.172 --> 00:02.853
I'm planning to go on a trip with my sister.

00:03.455 --> 00:04.855
You two must be excited.

00:05.231 --> 00:05.834
Yes!

00:06.141 --> 00:07.836
Do you have a brother or sister?

00:08.231 --> 00:09.615
I have one older brother.

00:10.581 --> 00:13.419
When was the last time you went on a trip with him?

00:14.512 --> 00:15.977
Gee, I can't remember.

00:16.986 --> 00:19.892
My sister and I go on a trip every summer.

00:21.579 --> 00:24.341
Maybe I should plan a trip with my brother, too.

00:26.165 --> 00:27.767
When did you take this picture?

00:28.473 --> 00:29.369
Is this your sister?

00:29.993 --> 00:30.376
Yes!

00:30.567 --> 00:31.548
That's my older sister.

00:31.779 --> 00:32.076
Wow.

00:32.263 --> 00:34.040
We took it last summer when we were in Hawaii.

00:34.508 --> 00:36.402
You two look a lot alike.

00:36.879 --> 00:38.399
Do you have any other siblings?

00:38.963 --> 00:39.318
Yeah!

00:39.419 --> 00:40.905
Well, I have a younger sister.

00:41.365 --> 00:42.839
She looks very different, though.

00:43.771 --> 00:44.585
I envy you.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.551
It must be nice to have so many siblings.

00:47.010 --> 00:50.224
Well, sometimes it's annoying to have sisters.

00:52.379 --> 00:55.228
As an only child, I've always wished I could have a sibling.
