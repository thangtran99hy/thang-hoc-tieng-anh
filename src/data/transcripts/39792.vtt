00:00.327 --> 00:01.981
Excuse me, Dr. Lynne?

00:02.149 --> 00:03.907
Could we go over your schedule for today?

00:04.333 --> 00:08.714
At 12:30, Dr. Carrington will be stopping by to discuss some things,...

00:09.069 --> 00:10.918
...but you can't talk to him for long.

00:11.238 --> 00:12.637
You have a meeting at 1:00,...

00:13.021 --> 00:15.114
...and that should last for about half an hour.

00:15.593 --> 00:18.115
I'll be here until 3:30 to answer any calls.
