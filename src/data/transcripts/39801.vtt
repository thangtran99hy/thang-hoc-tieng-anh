Hey, do you want to see the Dying Breeders?

00:04.266 --> 00:05.360
Sorry, can you say that again?

00:05.919 --> 00:09.031
The Dying Breeders. It's a new movie with Sam Sift.

00:09.505 --> 00:13.997
Oh yeah. Yes I do, but I'm going to a library tonight. I'm going to study.

00:15.629 --> 00:16.497
What time does it start?

00:17.359 --> 00:17.887
Let me see.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.656
The next show is at 6:45.

00:22.877 --> 00:26.385
6:45. I'm going to meet Shane at 9. We're studying together.

00:27.514 --> 00:28.351
What time does it finish?

00:29.811 --> 00:31.095
It finishes at 8:50.

00:31.505 --> 00:32.516
Did you say 8:50?

00:32.775 --> 00:33.119
I did.

00:33.863 --> 00:34.507
Where's the movie?

00:35.163 --> 00:37.937
Fourth Street. It's at that small theater on Fourth Street.

00:38.192 --> 00:39.323
Oh yeah, I know it.

00:40.203 --> 00:42.192
You can walk to the library in ten minutes.

00:42.754 --> 00:44.392
I can run to the library in ten minutes.

00:44.527 --> 00:47.095
Yeah, I guess. But it's not too far.

00:47.661 --> 00:47.979
Yeah.
