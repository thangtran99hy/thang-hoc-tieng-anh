00:00.877 --> 00:02.522
Yeah, why don't I start today?

00:04.259 --> 00:10.648
I just want to acknowledge the injury with Tyler Roberts.

00:12.071 --> 00:14.657
It was a kind of a freak accident on the pitch...

00:14.751 --> 00:19.995
...and we knew it was going to be a pretty heavy injury right away,...

00:20.106 --> 00:24.063
...but Tyler was adamant about wanting to stay on the pitch for the rest of the match,...

00:24.138 --> 00:25.345
...which I appreciated...

00:25.420 --> 00:28.325
...and it helped us a little bit maybe in set piece situations and whatnot.

00:29.819 --> 00:31.599
But he had a successful surgery,...

00:32.680 --> 00:36.218
...which we texted a little bit after the surgery and he was in positive spirits...

00:36.314 --> 00:38.163
...and the surgeon feels like it went well,...

00:38.234 --> 00:40.592
...so we're hopeful that he'll have a full recovery...

00:41.371 --> 00:44.727
...and in three to four months time be strong and ready and back at 100%

00:46.611 --> 00:51.123
Jesse, can you just sort of sum up how your time has been here so far...

00:51.213 --> 00:53.479
...with ten days, first game under your belt?

00:53.567 --> 00:55.531
How's the settling in period?

00:55.621 --> 00:59.063
Yeah, you know the nice thing is, it's slowing down a little bit.

00:59.947 --> 01:02.556
The first days when you come, there's a million things on your mind...

01:02.634 --> 01:06.361
...and a million things to take care of and you gotta get to know people more and more.

01:07.981 --> 01:10.139
Now we've spent more intensive time with each other,...

01:10.221 --> 01:14.970
...everything from the people here at the training center to the staff at the stadium...

01:15.287 --> 01:19.935
...to obviously the players and I think that we've enjoyed our time together.

01:20.021 --> 01:21.245
It's been very positive.

01:21.710 --> 01:25.103
We obviously felt good about the first performance...

01:25.219 --> 01:30.121
...despite not getting the result that we thought we wanted and frankly deserved,...

01:31.891 --> 01:39.132
...but we know that those good feelings will stay strong when we can get the results.

01:39.257 --> 01:42.933
So the focus and concentration to try to push every day...

01:43.015 --> 01:46.282
...to understand exactly what direction we want to go and it has been good...

01:46.360 --> 01:48.663
...and we will need that in this coming week.
