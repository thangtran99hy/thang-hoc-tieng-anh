00:01.808 --> 00:03.102
Did you just arrive?

00:03.867 --> 00:05.346
We got here on the 3rd.

00:05.843 --> 00:07.456
And do you plan to stay long?

00:08.129 --> 00:08.767
Yes.

00:09.063 --> 00:11.079
We are not leaving until the end of the month.

00:11.496 --> 00:12.467
The 31st?

00:12.881 --> 00:13.579
That's right.

00:17.113 --> 00:19.297
When are you going on vacation, Nick?

00:19.769 --> 00:21.331
We're leaving on August 16th.

00:21.979 --> 00:23.358
And when are you coming back?

00:24.053 --> 00:25.155
On August 23rd.

00:25.896 --> 00:30.120
Oh no, that means you'll miss my party on the 22nd.

00:30.637 --> 00:31.312
What do you mean?

00:31.530 --> 00:33.100
I'll be back before the 27th.

00:33.753 --> 00:36.969
I said the 22nd, not the 27th.

00:37.460 --> 00:39.172
But maybe I can change the date.

00:39.685 --> 00:41.573
Are you free on the 31st?
