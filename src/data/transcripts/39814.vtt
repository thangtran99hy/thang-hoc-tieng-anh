00:00.227 --> 00:04.535
To reach European sports is as far away from realistic at the moment.

00:04.633 --> 00:06.455
So we don't have this.

00:07.290 --> 00:10.654
Maybe dreaming for fans is always allowed.

00:10.863 --> 00:14.827
For us, it's important that we are very clear how good we are.

00:15.312 --> 00:18.604
We have shown that we can compete against also the best teams in the league.

00:18.770 --> 00:23.797
This is a very good signal, but the tough games are also against the teams.

00:23.933 --> 00:27.485
They are, maybe, on the bottom part of the table,...

00:27.571 --> 00:29.885
...but we have shown in the past that we can also win these games.

00:29.971 --> 00:33.603
They are super tough to win and we see that also other teams are struggling.

00:33.709 --> 00:35.850
Winning games in the Premier League is always super tough,...

00:36.699 --> 00:40.489
...but we have managed it in the past and I think this is also good to see.

00:40.725 --> 00:44.025
But yeah, we will have to look how often we can reach this level...

00:44.108 --> 00:46.068
...and how often we perform at the highest level.

00:46.173 --> 00:49.207
If we do it very often, then we take points and points and points...

00:49.280 --> 00:51.200
...and then we'll see where we end up at the end of the season.

00:51.273 --> 00:52.327
This is the way we want to go.

00:52.603 --> 00:56.811
There are so many good, young, talented players out there,...

00:56.897 --> 01:00.844
...and they should know that there is a very good spot...

01:00.955 --> 01:05.005
...to get your first Premier League experiences.

01:05.097 --> 01:08.735
And I think, meanwhile, we have this image back,...

01:08.830 --> 01:11.349
...and I think this is a good image to have as a club.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.669
Kyle had little problems with his hamstring.

01:13.903 --> 01:19.891
That's also the reason why we subbed him from yesterday's game; that's it so far.

01:21.805 --> 01:25.645
But obviously, we have problems with Sali and with Moi:...

01:25.921 --> 01:31.307
...Moi with his heel and Sali with his, also hamstring, I think.

01:32.516 --> 01:35.561
That's the reason why they weren't available yesterday.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.675
So a few lads with a few issues,...

01:38.785 --> 01:42.788
...but we will have a look at how far they are for the weekend...

01:42.902 --> 01:44.741
...and if they are available, we will see.
