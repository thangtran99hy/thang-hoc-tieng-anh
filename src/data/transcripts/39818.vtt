Hello?

00:06.628 --> 00:07.027
Hello.

00:07.493 --> 00:10.297
Is that Jennifer Zielinski?

00:10.604 --> 00:11.671
Yes, who's that?

00:12.158 --> 00:13.485
This is Rob Walker.

00:14.202 --> 00:14.967
I'm sorry, who?

00:16.824 --> 00:17.526
Rob Walker.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.219
I work for London 24/7.

00:21.025 --> 00:24.285
We need to talk about your trip to London in March.

00:25.486 --> 00:31.523
You arrive on the 12th of March and you leave on the 19th.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.247
Is that right?

00:32.785 --> 00:34.683
I'm really sorry, Mr. Walker.

00:35.406 --> 00:35.948
Rob.

00:36.317 --> 00:37.544
But, I'm not at work.

00:37.707 --> 00:39.310
Today is a holiday here.

00:39.791 --> 00:40.818
A holiday?

00:41.145 --> 00:41.731
Yes.

00:42.072 --> 00:43.733
You know, it's Thanksgiving.

00:44.569 --> 00:47.322
I'm at my parents' house, with my family.

00:48.137 --> 00:49.462
Thanksgiving, of course.

00:49.723 --> 00:52.696
Sorry, we don't have Thanksgiving in England.

00:53.334 --> 00:54.039
No problem.

00:54.685 --> 00:58.069
Listen, call me on Monday at work.

00:58.515 --> 01:01.185
No, not Monday, Tuesday.

01:02.415 --> 01:05.659
Tuesday, the 3rd of December?

01:05.905 --> 01:06.401
Yes!

01:06.752 --> 01:07.549
Jenny!

01:07.840 --> 01:09.217
Hurry up!

01:09.515 --> 01:10.792
Talk to you on Tuesday.

01:11.244 --> 01:12.123
Thanks for calling.

01:12.565 --> 01:13.274
Bye.

01:13.783 --> 01:14.195
Bye.
