00:03.231 --> 00:05.208
Where are my earrings?

00:05.897 --> 00:07.151
Are they on the table?

00:07.521 --> 00:08.420
No.

00:09.555 --> 00:11.094
Oh, here they are!

00:11.396 --> 00:12.431
In my purse.

00:12.883 --> 00:15.243
Now, where's my watch?

00:16.967 --> 00:19.917
Hmm, it's not in my purse.

00:20.363 --> 00:21.059
Where...

00:21.183 --> 00:21.949
There it is!

00:22.672 --> 00:24.154
In front of the television.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.081
Oh, of course!

00:26.451 --> 00:27.484
Thanks, Joe.

00:27.995 --> 00:28.981
Let's see.

00:29.492 --> 00:30.933
My sunglasses...

00:31.307 --> 00:32.645
...where are they?

00:33.079 --> 00:34.633
Next to my watch?

00:34.890 --> 00:35.579
No.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.371
Are they behind your purse?

00:37.762 --> 00:39.521
No, they aren't.

00:40.129 --> 00:41.815
Oh, they're on the chair!

00:42.040 --> 00:42.719
Great!

00:43.105 --> 00:45.798
Now, I just need one more thing.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.082
My camera.

00:47.579 --> 00:49.220
Maybe it's on the table.

00:49.697 --> 00:51.045
No, it's not.

00:51.632 --> 00:53.356
It's under the table.
