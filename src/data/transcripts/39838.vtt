Welcome to my new apartment, Terry.

00:03.241 --> 00:05.048
Thanks for having me, Karina.

00:05.407 --> 00:06.455
It looks great!

00:07.007 --> 00:09.753
It's quite small, but it is very comfortable.

00:10.375 --> 00:12.901
So, is this your living room?

00:13.293 --> 00:14.181
Yes, it is.

00:14.644 --> 00:18.175
This is my sofa, and that is my plant.

00:18.421 --> 00:19.329
I see.

00:19.836 --> 00:23.106
And these are our pictures from our trip to Europe.

00:23.409 --> 00:24.761
Very nice!

00:25.233 --> 00:26.972
These are our cushions.

00:27.267 --> 00:28.707
They are gifts from my mother.

00:29.123 --> 00:30.271
They are lovely.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.939
And through there, that is our kitchen.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.078
Wow! It's great.

00:36.407 --> 00:37.073
Thank you.
