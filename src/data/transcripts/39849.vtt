My house is an old house.

00:02.205 --> 00:03.072
It's near the town.

00:03.578 --> 00:04.743
There are ten rooms in my house.

00:05.248 --> 00:08.429
There are three bedrooms, two bathrooms, dining room,...

00:08.576 --> 00:11.007
...a living room, a family room and the kitchen.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.612
In the kitchen, there are twelve cupboards,...

00:13.849 --> 00:15.454
....and the stove is next to the fridge.

00:16.102 --> 00:18.611
My favorite room is the kitchen because that's where the food is.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.136
My home is a new house.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.717

00:27.787 --> 00:31.674
Two big bedrooms, two small bedrooms, three bathrooms,...

00:31.979 --> 00:34.656
...a living room, a kitchen and a dining room.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.590
My favorite room is the dining room.

00:38.140 --> 00:41.177
There's a piano, a dining room table,...

00:41.569 --> 00:43.983
...and on the walls, there are paintings.

I love to be there.
