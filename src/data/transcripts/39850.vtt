00:00.530 --> 00:03.019
Filipinos back then had higher standard of government.

00:03.807 --> 00:05.831
Back then, we had someone called a datu,...

00:06.739 --> 00:10.349
...which are basically tribe chiefs and usually served his people well.

00:10.520 --> 00:14.650
And unlike Spanish rulers, a datu can be legally impeached by the normal people.

00:15.454 --> 00:18.345
Also to your surprise, we had a justice system back then.

00:19.122 --> 00:23.716
It may not be as complicated as the justice system now, but it worked for them back then.

00:25.224 --> 00:26.615
Next is life and culture.

00:27.418 --> 00:30.712
Back then, we were self-sufficient in terms of food and other resources,...

00:30.946 --> 00:34.611
...contrary to popular belief that we are always starving during those times.

00:35.391 --> 00:37.168
We also had farming back then.

00:37.366 --> 00:40.170
One notable farms we had during the pre-colonial period...

00:40.251 --> 00:44.903
...and still around until now is the Banaue Rice Terraces located north of the country.

00:45.631 --> 00:47.793
And one last thing I would like to mention is that...

00:48.028 --> 00:50.470
...Magellan did not first discover the Philippines.

00:51.253 --> 00:53.975
Way before he came to our shores on 1521,...

00:54.248 --> 00:56.476
...we were already trading with Japan and China...

00:56.667 --> 00:59.031
...several years before he discovered the Philippines,...

00:59.926 --> 01:02.158
...so basically contrary to popular belief...

01:02.253 --> 01:06.197
...about the Filipinos being jungle living savages during the pre-colonial times.

01:07.054 --> 01:11.586
In reality, the Philippines during the pre-colonial days had a very advanced culture.

01:12.431 --> 01:16.653
Basically anything that is contradictory to Spanish culture was considered barbaric.

01:18.766 --> 01:21.237
The pre-colonial period finally came to an end...

01:21.335 --> 01:26.765
...when the Philippines was discovered in the year 1521 and colonized on year 1565.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.992
The Spaniards started Westernizing the Filipinos introducing Christianity...

01:32.186 --> 01:35.944
...and traditional Filipino culture started to be replaced with Western culture.
