Hi, friends.

00:01.666 --> 00:02.389
How are you?

00:02.816 --> 00:06.017
Today we are going to learn the prepositions of place...

00:06.906 --> 00:08.817
...to know how to say where things are.

00:09.794 --> 00:11.685
Mary, I need your help.

00:12.276 --> 00:15.635
I have to pack, and I cannot find anything. Please!

00:16.556 --> 00:18.823
You are a disaster, Tio English!

00:19.443 --> 00:20.976
What do you need to find?

00:21.717 --> 00:23.863
I'm looking for my red shoes.

00:24.361 --> 00:25.383
Let me see!

00:25.918 --> 00:28.296
They are here, in front of the sofa.

00:29.651 --> 00:31.253
And where will the umbrella be?

00:31.827 --> 00:32.791
It might rain!

00:33.174 --> 00:35.066
It's here, behind the door.

00:36.148 --> 00:38.667
And the camera, I cannot find it.

00:39.311 --> 00:39.989
Take it!

00:40.630 --> 00:43.710
It was next to the TV, beside the TV.

00:44.391 --> 00:45.837
Wow, thanks!

00:46.285 --> 00:47.089
What more?

00:47.961 --> 00:49.078
Where is the laptop?

00:49.983 --> 00:51.972
The computer is on the table.

00:53.064 --> 00:54.612
Where did I leave the cell phone?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.026
Call me, please.

00:58.149 --> 01:00.474
Here, it was under the cushions.

01:00.975 --> 01:02.018
What a mess!
