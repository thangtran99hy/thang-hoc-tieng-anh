Nine-year-old Edmar and his younger brother, Cedric, don't know it,...

00:05.029 --> 00:06.242
...but they're breaking the law.

00:06.619 --> 00:10.006
Neither of them can read or write, but instead of going to school,...

00:10.200 --> 00:12.719
...they spend their days scavenging to earn a living.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.949
There are tens of thousands of others like them,...

00:16.175 --> 00:18.037
...needing to help their families survive...

00:18.171 --> 00:21.217
...despite primary education being mandatory in the Philippines.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.748
Not that being in a classroom would give them much of one.

00:26.134 --> 00:29.985
Concerned educators say a lack of investment has hurt standards.

00:30.421 --> 00:34.553
The Philippines spends just two percent of its gross domestic product on education.

00:35.019 --> 00:38.003
The World Bank recommended amount is six percent.

00:38.446 --> 00:44.303
There are certain areas where we have been unable to provide enough resources...

00:44.400 --> 00:46.047
...in terms of classrooms.

00:46.134 --> 00:52.028
Some of the basic resources for education: classrooms, textbooks, teachers.

00:52.446 --> 00:56.011
Nineteen million students are enrolled in state-run schools this year,...

00:56.216 --> 01:00.005
...but 42% are expected to drop out before graduation.

01:00.462 --> 01:03.539
For now, these pupils are some of the fortunate ones.

01:03.833 --> 01:06.229
They have a classroom and even a teacher.

01:06.581 --> 01:10.333
Many classrooms end up empty, even on a regular school day.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.989
The lack of teachers has meant that when one is absent,...

01:13.140 --> 01:15.117
...there usually isn't a substitute available.

01:15.217 --> 01:16.879
Now, what that means for the students is...

01:17.374 --> 01:19.613
...they have to either get split up into other classrooms...

01:19.689 --> 01:23.200
...that now become overcrowded or they just don't bother to come in at all.

01:25.526 --> 01:29.168
It doesn't help that teachers are not just underpaid but badly managed.

01:29.511 --> 01:31.845
Many go abroad in search of higher salaries,...

01:32.030 --> 01:33.807
...and quite a number of those that stay...

01:34.009 --> 01:36.777
...are made to teach subjects they haven't been trained for.

01:37.353 --> 01:41.266
If people leave it to government and just hope they have the right thing,...

01:41.681 --> 01:42.795
...it will never be enough.

01:43.821 --> 01:47.301
For Edicio Dela Torre, education should be everyone's concern.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.649
His group, E-NET,...

01:49.732 --> 01:53.335
...is pushing for reform and wants to fill in the gaps in the state system.

01:53.885 --> 01:56.931
One of their projects is to conduct classes with flexible hours...

01:57.263 --> 02:01.949
...so that those that have to work or are marginalized can still get an education.
