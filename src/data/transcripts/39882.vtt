00:01.185 --> 00:02.537
Do you mind if I join you?

00:02.817 --> 00:03.561
Of course not!

00:03.743 --> 00:04.495
Come on, sit down.

00:04.699 --> 00:05.104
Thank you.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.951
I have to leave in a minute anyway.

00:12.172 --> 00:14.010
Could I have a large latte, please?

00:14.300 --> 00:14.831
Of course.

00:15.473 --> 00:16.114
Your latte.

00:16.401 --> 00:17.155
Oh, thanks.

00:18.117 --> 00:19.345
Can you pass the sugar?

00:19.754 --> 00:20.245
Sure.

00:21.161 --> 00:24.847
Oh, speaking of friends, I want to ask you a favor.

00:25.265 --> 00:27.861
Is it okay if we change our plans a bit this week?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.335
Sure, what's up?

00:29.789 --> 00:32.083
I just had a call from an old friend of mine.

00:32.345 --> 00:33.977
Could you do me a big favor?

00:34.090 --> 00:35.921
I have to work late this evening,...

00:36.039 --> 00:38.021
...so would you mind meeting him at the airport?

00:38.500 --> 00:39.031
Not at all.

00:39.241 --> 00:40.077
I'd like to meet him.

00:40.589 --> 00:42.636
And do you think you could take him to my flat?

00:43.109 --> 00:44.079
I'll give you the keys.

00:44.172 --> 00:45.035
No problem, Rob.

00:45.594 --> 00:46.949
Thank you so much, Jenny.

00:47.066 --> 00:47.789
You're a real star.
