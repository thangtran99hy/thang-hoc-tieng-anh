00:00.858 --> 00:02.945
Do four-day weeks work?

00:03.723 --> 00:06.417
When French company boss Laurent de la Clergerie...

00:06.496 --> 00:09.389
...decided to let his staff work a four-day week...

00:09.690 --> 00:11.415
...on the same pay as before,...

00:11.805 --> 00:14.398
...some people took him for a crazy person.

00:15.103 --> 00:19.664
But a year on, his LDLC company selling consumer technology...

00:19.963 --> 00:23.427
...has increased annual turnover by 40 percent...

00:23.804 --> 00:26.007
...without hiring any extra staff.

00:26.701 --> 00:29.803
As the world emerges from a global health crisis...

00:29.983 --> 00:33.733
...that prompted many people to reevaluate their work-life balance,...

00:34.110 --> 00:38.121
...companies and workers around the world are asking an important question.

00:38.453 --> 00:39.616
Can they work less?

00:41.793 --> 00:45.102
De la Clergerie says before he embarked on the change,...

00:45.372 --> 00:46.295
...he did the math.

00:46.571 --> 00:50.197
LDLC employs approximately 1,000 people.

00:50.892 --> 00:53.388
He worked out that even in the worst-case scenario,...

00:53.523 --> 00:58.633
...the change would add to labor costs by at most 1.6 million dollars per year.

00:59.194 --> 01:02.019
It was a manageable risk he was willing to take.

01:02.175 --> 01:06.287
Since then, he said that absenteeism and sick leaves have gone down.

01:06.493 --> 01:08.970
The company has also not had to hire new people...

01:09.037 --> 01:11.149
...to offset the reduction in hours worked.

01:11.629 --> 01:14.914
And although the four-day week is not the only factor,...

01:15.407 --> 01:19.165
...De la Clergerie says it contributed to a jump in turnover...

01:19.388 --> 01:26.852
...from around 550 million dollars before the change to nearly 770 million dollars.
