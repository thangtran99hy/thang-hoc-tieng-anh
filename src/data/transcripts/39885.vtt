00:00.389 --> 00:03.535
The feed goes silent and so does the audience...

00:03.605 --> 00:06.421
...after Will Smith takes a swing at Chris Rock...

00:06.498 --> 00:08.553
...on stage at the Oscars.

00:08.901 --> 00:13.224
It all went down after Chris made a crack about Will's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith,...

00:13.353 --> 00:14.669
...and her shaved head.

00:14.865 --> 00:17.075
While Will appears to laugh at first,...

00:17.173 --> 00:20.585
...things immediately turned sour as he takes to the stage,...

00:20.791 --> 00:23.557
...slapping Chris straight across the face.

00:23.738 --> 00:24.949
Uh-oh, Richard!

00:28.961 --> 00:30.261
Oh, wow!

00:30.991 --> 00:31.869
Wow!

00:32.614 --> 00:34.965
The sound on the broadcast suddenly cut out...

00:35.037 --> 00:37.123
...in the moments following the altercation,...

00:37.395 --> 00:40.410
...but international markets saw the feed in full,...

00:40.719 --> 00:42.707
...Will shouting at the top of his lungs,...

00:42.821 --> 00:45.440
..."Keep my wife's name out of your mouth!"

00:46.172 --> 00:48.629
Clearly shaken and unsure how to proceed,...

00:48.731 --> 00:52.973
...Chris responds the best way he knows how: with another joke.

00:54.316 --> 00:58.079
That was the greatest night in the history of television.

00:58.270 --> 00:58.610
Okay.

00:59.857 --> 01:02.879
As for why the joke may have hit a nerve for the couple,...

01:03.132 --> 01:06.471
...Jada was diagnosed with alopecia in 2018,...

01:06.731 --> 01:11.054
...a hair loss condition which she has spoken about publicly many times.
