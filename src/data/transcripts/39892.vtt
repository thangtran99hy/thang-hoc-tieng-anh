00:00.883 --> 00:09.083
I know, to do what we do, you gotta be able to take abuse.

00:09.261 --> 00:12.865
...and you gotta be able to have people talk crazy about you.

00:14.075 --> 00:18.688
In this business, you gotta be able to have people disrespecting you...

00:20.667 --> 00:23.172
...and you gotta smile and you gotta pretend like that's OK.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.605
I want to apologize to the Academy.

00:26.715 --> 00:30.251
I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees.

00:39.218 --> 00:48.536
This is a beautiful moment and I'm not crying for winning an award.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.283
It's not about winning an award for me.

00:51.555 --> 00:57.436
It's about being able to shine light on all of the people.

00:57.912 --> 00:59.103
Art imitates life.

00:59.263 --> 01:01.950
I look like the crazy father, just like they said.

01:03.259 --> 01:06.829
I look like the crazy father just like they said about Richard Williams.

01:08.832 --> 01:11.792
But love will make you do crazy things.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.047
Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wife.

01:18.201 --> 01:19.584
I'm taking up too much time.

01:22.201 --> 01:28.767
Thank you for this honor, thank you for this moment...

01:28.878 --> 01:34.319
...and thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene, the entire Williams family.

01:35.749 --> 01:36.586
Thank you.

01:36.759 --> 01:39.335
I'm hoping the Academy invites me back.

01:39.595 --> 01:40.098
Thank you.
