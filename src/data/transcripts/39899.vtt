When he was two years old, he ran off and they found him sleeping in the barn...

00:09.913 --> 00:13.547
...between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion.

00:16.063 --> 00:20.223
She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.

00:24.125 --> 00:28.537
I read this article about what you do for people with horse problems.

00:28.641 --> 00:31.021
The truth is I help horses with people problems.

00:38.257 --> 00:39.438
We expecting company?

00:40.268 --> 00:41.333
Mr. Booker?

00:41.484 --> 00:42.177
Yeah.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.737
I want you to take a look at my horse.

00:48.729 --> 00:50.041
I don't know if I can do anything,...

00:50.537 --> 00:52.757
...but I'm prepared to give it a go if you'll help.

00:54.908 --> 00:55.783
Do you have a problem with that?

00:56.451 --> 00:57.850
Isn't it like obvious?

00:58.704 --> 00:59.281
Not to me.

01:05.971 --> 01:09.131
When I work with a horse, I like to know its history.

01:10.753 --> 01:12.986
If I'm gonna figure out what's going on in his head,...

01:13.563 --> 01:17.104
...it'd sure help me if I knew exactly what happened that night.

01:22.726 --> 01:25.342
Are you afraid of anything, Tom Booker?

01:31.194 --> 01:32.568
Just make yourself comfortable.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.119
I am comfortable.

01:35.061 --> 01:38.664
Well, in that case, you can bring in the pasta.

01:39.588 --> 01:40.405
You missed a button.

01:41.314 --> 01:41.821
Thank you.
