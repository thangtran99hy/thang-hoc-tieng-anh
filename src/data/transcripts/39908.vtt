And the Grammy goes to "Sour," Olivia Rodrigo.

00:08.281 --> 00:09.263
Oh, wow!

00:09.427 --> 00:10.338
Oh my gosh.

00:11.590 --> 00:13.323
Thank you again to the recording academy.

00:13.627 --> 00:15.625
Thanks to all the fans who have listened to my music...

00:15.744 --> 00:18.269
...and completely changed my life over the past two years.

00:19.309 --> 00:21.600
I really want to dedicate this award to my parents.

00:22.258 --> 00:25.771
When I was nine years old, I told my mom I was going to be an Olympic gymnast...

00:25.901 --> 00:27.555
...even though I could barely do a cartwheel,...

00:28.607 --> 00:32.213
...and she thought I was joking, but I'm super defensive.

00:32.809 --> 00:35.622
And so, the next week when I told her I was going to win a Grammy,...

00:36.069 --> 00:38.185
...she was very supportive even though I'm sure she thought...

00:38.255 --> 00:39.905
...it was just a little kid pipe dream.

00:41.123 --> 00:44.073
But I want to thank my mom for being supportive of all of my dreams...

00:44.138 --> 00:45.078
...no matter how crazy,...

00:45.513 --> 00:48.459
...and I want to thank my mom and my dad for being equally as proud of me...

00:48.811 --> 00:52.069
...for winning a Grammy as they were when I learned how to do a back walkover.

00:53.224 --> 00:56.142
This is for you guys and because of you guys, thank you.
