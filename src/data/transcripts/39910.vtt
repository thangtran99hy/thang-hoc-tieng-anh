00:00.240 --> 00:00.753
The war.

00:01.300 --> 00:02.761
What is more opposite to music?

00:03.122 --> 00:05.143
The silence of ruined cities and killed people.

00:06.143 --> 00:09.233
Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars.

00:09.654 --> 00:14.243
Over 400 children have been injured and 153 children died,...

00:14.704 --> 00:16.311
...and we'll never see them drawing.

00:16.826 --> 00:19.291
Our parents are happy to wake up in the morning...

00:19.415 --> 00:21.527
...in bomb shelters, but alive.

00:22.028 --> 00:24.996
Our loved ones don't know if we will be together again.

00:25.102 --> 00:27.867
The war doesn't let us choose who survives...

00:28.311 --> 00:30.326
...and who stays in eternal silence.

00:30.609 --> 00:34.055
Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos.

00:34.149 --> 00:36.987
They sing to the wounded in hospitals...

00:37.212 --> 00:38.945
...even to those who can't hear them,...

00:39.181 --> 00:41.687
...but the music will break through anyway.

00:42.085 --> 00:45.097
We defend our freedom to live, to love, to sound.

00:45.363 --> 00:47.521
On our land, we are fighting Russia,...

00:47.826 --> 00:50.411
...which brings horrible silence with its bombs,...

00:50.519 --> 00:51.883
...the dead silence.

00:52.111 --> 00:53.952
Fill the silence with your music!

00:54.047 --> 00:56.311
Fill it today to tell our story.

00:56.934 --> 01:00.629
Tell the truth about this war on your social networks, on TV.

01:00.755 --> 01:02.426
Support us in any way you can.

01:02.525 --> 01:04.296
Any but not silence.

01:04.658 --> 01:05.754
And then peace will come...

01:06.274 --> 01:09.355
...to all our cities the war is destroying:...

01:09.623 --> 01:12.883
...Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Volnovakha, Mariupol and others.

01:13.026 --> 01:14.440
They are legends already,...

01:14.637 --> 01:17.885
...but I have a dream of them living and free,...

01:18.091 --> 01:20.523
...free like you on the Grammy stage.
