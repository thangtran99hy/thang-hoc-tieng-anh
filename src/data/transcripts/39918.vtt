00:00.144 --> 00:03.841
What would happen if everyone in the world was suddenly a vegetarian?

00:04.239 --> 00:06.715
What effect would it have on our lives and the planet?

00:07.012 --> 00:08.792
Before we begin, full disclosure:...

00:08.969 --> 00:11.312
...none of us at AsapSCIENCE are vegetarians...

00:11.427 --> 00:14.267
...and the worldwide rate of vegetarianism is fairly low,...

00:14.590 --> 00:17.540
...ranging from about four to five percent in the US and Canada...

00:17.837 --> 00:19.937
...to a little over 30 percent in India.

00:20.217 --> 00:23.823
As a result, there are currently about 20 billion chickens,...

00:24.058 --> 00:26.904
...1.5 billion cows, over a billion sheep...

00:26.997 --> 00:28.956
...and nearly a billion pigs in the world.

00:29.214 --> 00:31.855
Without any meat-eating humans to provide a market,...

00:32.046 --> 00:34.655
...whole herds of domestic animals would disappear...

00:34.841 --> 00:37.708
...and this would free up vast quantities of land.

00:37.885 --> 00:41.605
About 33 million square kilometers of land are used for pasture,...

00:41.836 --> 00:44.069
...an area about the size of Africa...

00:44.303 --> 00:46.785
...and that's not even counting the land used to grow crops...

00:46.865 --> 00:48.447
...exclusively for animal feed.

00:48.803 --> 00:51.701
Some of it would be needed for the increased amount of vegetable crops,...

00:51.973 --> 00:54.207
...but much of the land currently used as pasture...

00:54.298 --> 00:56.473
...is actually too dry to grow crops.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.904
Without humans adding artificial nutrients,...

00:59.032 --> 01:02.129
...this land could turn to desert, but if properly managed,...

01:02.281 --> 01:03.906
....it's possible that some farmland...

01:04.051 --> 01:07.083
...would return to its natural state of grassland or forest,...

01:07.331 --> 01:09.664
...which could help counteract global climate change.

01:09.881 --> 01:13.877
After all, the loss of CO2-absorbing trees cleared for agriculture...

01:13.955 --> 01:17.172
...is a major reason why global levels of CO2 are going up.

01:17.409 --> 01:19.749
Cows and other grazers also affect our climate...

01:19.926 --> 01:21.751
...through large amounts of methane production,...

01:21.970 --> 01:25.885
...which has 25 times more potential planet-warming power than CO2.

01:26.271 --> 01:28.648
Combined with the loss of forests and other effects,...

01:28.842 --> 01:30.593
...livestock production is responsible...

01:30.714 --> 01:33.843
...for about 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,...

01:34.153 --> 01:35.831
...which is more than all the world's...

01:35.985 --> 01:38.477
...planes, trains and automobiles put together.

01:38.813 --> 01:42.036
In fact, many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption,...

01:42.271 --> 01:45.556
...may be one of the best strategies for managing climate change.
