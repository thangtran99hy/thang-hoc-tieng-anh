00:00.095 --> 00:03.231
In 1918, a flu pandemic started,...

00:03.335 --> 00:06.331
...which ended up killing more people than the First World War.

00:06.583 --> 00:10.571
It's the poster child for pandemics for how serious they can be.

00:10.845 --> 00:14.619
But over time, it eventually became just the seasonal flu...

00:14.753 --> 00:15.823
...which came around every year.

00:20.697 --> 00:23.001
As a virus spreads through society,...

00:23.220 --> 00:26.507
...we gain protection through vaccinations and exposure.

00:26.810 --> 00:29.929
Subsequent waves can be less severe as a result...

00:30.381 --> 00:32.995
...which can lead to a stable endemic disease.

00:33.462 --> 00:37.823
Influenza and flu remain a serious virus and a serious disease.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.742
Endemic is only saying something about...

00:40.850 --> 00:43.926
...whether or not you're getting large epidemics, large outbreaks.

00:44.091 --> 00:45.641
It doesn't mean it's harmless.

00:46.237 --> 00:48.420
Because you can have an endemic disease,...

00:48.533 --> 00:51.717
..which is continuing all the time and which kills lots and lots of people.

00:52.196 --> 00:55.132
Tuberculosis is endemic in large parts of the world...

00:55.322 --> 00:56.659
...and it kills millions.

00:57.018 --> 00:59.705
Malaria is a similarly deadly killer.

01:00.509 --> 01:02.810
And yet it is considered to be endemic.

01:03.386 --> 01:04.198
In the future,...

01:04.479 --> 01:06.961
...COVID is going to be one of those diseases that we live with.

01:07.373 --> 01:11.263
And we also work very hard to minimize its severe consequences...

01:11.453 --> 01:13.636
...for human beings and the healthcare system.

01:14.004 --> 01:15.179
And we should be prepared...

01:15.289 --> 01:17.649
...to continue the battle against SARS-coV-2...

01:17.797 --> 01:20.591
...not just for the next few months, but going forward as well.

01:21.303 --> 01:22.432
It's on the people.

01:22.944 --> 01:23.626
It's all on us.
