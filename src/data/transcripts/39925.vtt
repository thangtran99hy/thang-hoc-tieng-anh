When we originally funded the Gates Scholarship in 2000,...

00:08.587 --> 00:11.870
...we wanted it to help exceptional students from all over the world...

00:12.092 --> 00:16.115
...experience Cambridge's 800-year legacy of higher education.

00:17.411 --> 00:20.036
Twenty years later, this scholarship has reached...

00:20.171 --> 00:24.697
...more than 2,000 students from 111 different countries.

00:26.108 --> 00:28.901
Gates Cambridge Scholars are now fighting for human rights,...

00:29.109 --> 00:32.553
...working to defeat COVID, and creating solutions...

00:32.840 --> 00:34.475
...to avoid climate change.

00:38.021 --> 00:41.865
My dad's parents never finished high school,...

00:42.543 --> 00:45.231
...and so, he always saw education...

00:45.354 --> 00:47.375
...as the thing that gave him opportunity.

00:47.773 --> 00:50.172
You and I want the world to be a better place,...

00:50.503 --> 00:54.603
...we're very anxious that it be better for as near to everybody...

00:54.694 --> 00:56.246
...as we can possibly make it.

00:56.609 --> 00:59.197
He dearly loved this University and this program,...

00:59.525 --> 01:01.632
...and once said, that, of all the grants we ever made,...

01:01.765 --> 01:02.736
...this was his favorite.

01:02.917 --> 01:09.275
What you're doing is producing effective, thoughtful leadership.

01:09.890 --> 01:13.618
It may seem small but, you know, over 20 years,...

01:13.962 --> 01:17.179
...we're talking about quite a few thoughtful,...

01:17.318 --> 01:19.841
...sophisticated, well-motivated leaders.

01:20.825 --> 01:22.858
And it's as simple as that.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.877
Even though my dad is no longer with us,...

01:29.213 --> 01:31.355
...the Gates Cambridge Scholarship program...

01:31.518 --> 01:34.624
...is an embodiment of his most cherished beliefs.

01:35.101 --> 01:38.073
That given the opportunity, human beings will come together...

01:38.571 --> 01:40.874
...and make the world a better place for everyone.
