When the first Ferrari left the gates of Maranello in 1947,...

00:09.239 --> 00:11.163
...it was more than a new car.

00:11.587 --> 00:13.731
It was a statement of intent,...

00:15.361 --> 00:19.431
...the beginning of a culture of excellence spanning 75 years...

00:20.121 --> 00:25.244
...built on craftmanship, dedication, tradition and innovation;...

00:27.518 --> 00:31.413
...a heritage built with passion to be lovingly maintained...

00:31.713 --> 00:34.137
...in its authentic, pristine perfection,...

00:35.501 --> 00:39.223
...a lineage which is continuously reinventing and evolving.

00:40.167 --> 00:47.067
Today, just as 75 years ago, every Ferrari that leaves our factory...

00:47.393 --> 00:49.214
...is more than a new car.

00:50.123 --> 00:53.589
Each has the innate potential to become a classic...

00:54.309 --> 00:56.672
...to live on forever.
