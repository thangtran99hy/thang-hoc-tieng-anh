Porsche is teaming up with Pixar...

00:04.874 --> 00:09.335
...to create a special one of one car inspired by Sally Carrera.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.037
It's fun because it's come full circle.

00:11.369 --> 00:14.069
We're inspired by the Porsche originally for the movie, Cars...

00:14.242 --> 00:18.608
...and now, that character is inspiring a new physical car.

00:18.864 --> 00:22.113
Sally Carrera in the film was the 2002 911...

00:22.221 --> 00:25.024
...and here we are, 20 years later, creating this new special project.

00:25.176 --> 00:27.620
We get to play car designers when we worked on Cars.

00:27.739 --> 00:29.803
Now, we're actually working with Porsche.

00:30.055 --> 00:32.786
One of our goals was not to create a car...

00:32.913 --> 00:34.726
...that copy pastes from the original one...

00:34.824 --> 00:36.712
...you know, with the eyes and the windscreen and the mouth.

00:36.805 --> 00:39.938
Instead, a real, street-legal, drivable car.

00:40.121 --> 00:42.150
This car is special and whoever has this car...

00:42.227 --> 00:44.801
...will have something unique that will probably never happen again.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.083
For this fundraiser, and being the 20th anniversary...

00:47.210 --> 00:49.079
...for the car that we used in the film for Sally,...

00:49.188 --> 00:51.267
...it's a great opportunity to kind of use this time...

00:51.383 --> 00:52.940
...to give back in the spirit of Sally.
