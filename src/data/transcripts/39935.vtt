Quantum physics is understanding at a fundamental level...

00:12.045 --> 00:16.037
...how the basic particles that make up our entire universe work.

00:19.077 --> 00:21.801
Quantum physics is a branch of Science,...

00:22.583 --> 00:26.069
...which describes the behavior of the particles...

00:26.145 --> 00:27.346
...in a microscopic world.

00:27.597 --> 00:33.288
In this world, systems can display very unusual physical phenomenon...

00:33.373 --> 00:36.263
...such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement.

00:47.353 --> 00:51.611
It's often had been said that nobody really understands quantum mechanics...

00:51.797 --> 00:53.952
... but the laws of quantum mechanics...

00:54.103 --> 00:57.702
...are in excellent agreement with our experimental observations,...

00:57.811 --> 01:00.229
...which is why we accept it as correct.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.309
Almost everything we do is quantum,...

01:02.427 --> 01:07.428
...because quantum mechanics underlies the physical world.

01:09.691 --> 01:11.261
I've worked with, what we call...

01:11.365 --> 01:14.027
...in the field, quantum dots and quantum wells.

01:14.479 --> 01:16.191
So, quantum is in the title,...

01:16.443 --> 01:21.977
...but more recently I've been working on a particular kind of...

01:22.257 --> 01:24.844
...quantum mechanical unit of information called the qubit.

01:32.373 --> 01:35.999
Quantum physics deals with the properties of nature...

01:36.167 --> 01:38.703
...on very small microscopic length scales.

01:41.213 --> 01:44.033
What we're used to thinking about physics...

01:44.112 --> 01:47.265
...is that it can predict the outcome of certain experiments.

01:47.352 --> 01:48.892
And what I find remarkable about quantum physics...

01:49.137 --> 01:54.187
...is that it essentially only allows you to predict the probability...

01:54.477 --> 01:56.028
...of the outcome of a certain experiment,...

01:56.165 --> 01:59.193
...which basically tells us that nature is not deterministic,...

01:59.282 --> 02:00.218
...but probabilistic.
