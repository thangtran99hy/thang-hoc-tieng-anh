Hello, I'm Emma Raducanu and I'm here today with Porsche.

00:14.926 --> 00:16.684
The dreams that kept me going back then...

00:17.040 --> 00:20.575
...were to win Grand Slams and to play at Wimbledon.

00:20.669 --> 00:23.815
For me, it's all about continuous improvement and getting better...

00:23.905 --> 00:26.883
...and just trying to learn and experience new things.

00:31.087 --> 00:33.677
I feel like my culture and my family background...

00:33.737 --> 00:34.926
...has definitely played a part...

00:35.045 --> 00:37.979
...in who I am and my personality and character.

00:40.275 --> 00:42.611
I love motorsports because I feel like...

00:42.797 --> 00:45.007
...it's just a drive for continuous improvement...

00:45.087 --> 00:48.090
...and I feel like it's actually quite similar to tennis.

00:51.548 --> 00:54.565
My favorite Porsche car is the 911 for sure...

00:54.661 --> 00:57.058
...because I feel like throughout every generation,...

00:57.138 --> 00:59.747
...it's so unique and so beautiful in its own distinct way,...

00:59.875 --> 01:03.374
...and I feel like it's one of the most iconic cars that are out there.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.914
Porsche has always been in my head.

01:08.983 --> 01:11.763
It's one of the brands that I've always loved from a young age.

01:11.908 --> 01:13.845
For me to be a brand ambassador for Porsche...

01:13.917 --> 01:15.925
...means a lot because I feel like...

01:16.299 --> 01:19.419
...now I might be able to sit on my own 911 one day...
