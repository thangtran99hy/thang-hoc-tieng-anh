Hello, hello!

00:02.090 --> 00:04.782
Maria, welcome to the world premiere this evening.

00:04.883 --> 00:06.417
How do you feel to be on the red carpet?

00:06.889 --> 00:08.805
Oh, I'm so happy to be here.

00:08.999 --> 00:13.941
I'm so honored and pleased to be part of this magical universe.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.831
You look fantastic.

00:16.015 --> 00:16.846
Oh, thank you.

00:16.920 --> 00:17.144
Yeah.

00:17.245 --> 00:17.573
Thank you.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.345
Lots of fans all over the world.

00:20.427 --> 00:21.355
So beautiful.

00:21.461 --> 00:21.972
Yes.

00:22.201 --> 00:26.985
Well, it's definitely true that the wizarding world fan base is a global thing.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.888
I'm curious to know how did the fans...

00:29.016 --> 00:34.059
How are the fans reacting back in Brazil, to you being part of the wizarding world?

00:34.375 --> 00:36.748
Yeah, there are lots of fans in Brazil.

00:36.869 --> 00:38.019
Yeah, it's huge!

00:38.383 --> 00:39.701
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:39.801 --> 00:41.225
I'm so happy, yeah.

00:41.390 --> 00:45.547
Do you have any fond memories that you remember being on set?

00:45.869 --> 00:47.526
Specifically, I know it's been awhile,...

00:47.597 --> 00:50.976
...coming here to celebrate it, but does anything stand out to you...

00:51.036 --> 00:56.126
...that was some of the best parts of being in the wizarding world?

00:56.897 --> 01:01.542
There are some, but I remember the day they gave me the wand.

01:02.043 --> 01:04.059
It was kind of special, you know.

01:04.164 --> 01:04.411
Yeah, yeah!

01:04.481 --> 01:06.491
Yes, I didn't know it was something like that.

01:06.594 --> 01:06.837
Yeah.

01:07.073 --> 01:07.431
Yeah.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.521
It's a bit beautiful.

01:08.623 --> 01:13.379
It's a big moment for any wizard or witch, also for any actor...

01:13.705 --> 01:15.234
...to be in the room where they get to do that.

01:15.323 --> 01:16.813
I didn't expect to feel like that.

01:16.897 --> 01:17.403
Yes!

01:17.667 --> 01:19.509
You know, it was special; it was beautiful.

01:19.603 --> 01:21.767
Yes, I understand, I understand.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.765
Well, thank you, thank you for your time.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.733
Enjoy tonight and I look forward to seeing you later.

01:26.981 --> 01:27.339
Thank you.

01:27.687 --> 01:28.343
My pleasure!
