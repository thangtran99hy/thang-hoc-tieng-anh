00:00.955 --> 00:06.135
From the very beginning, we believed the impossible is possible.

00:07.147 --> 00:10.407
We promised that we would connect minds and create the future.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.761
And together, we did.

00:13.495 --> 00:15.714
Together, we overcame the inconceivable.

00:17.109 --> 00:18.992
Together, we built the unprecedented.

00:22.961 --> 00:25.039
And together, we showed the world...

00:25.222 --> 00:27.370
...what the best of humanity can achieve.

00:29.130 --> 00:33.340
To every one of the 24 million guests that walked through our gates,...

00:34.877 --> 00:38.468
...to each of the 192 nations that welcomed the world with us,...

00:44.893 --> 00:47.008
...every child whose eyes widened,...

00:48.645 --> 00:51.287
...every volunteer who offered a helping hand,...

00:53.378 --> 00:56.697
...and every heart that helped make Expo a reality,...

01:00.256 --> 01:01.739
...we say "thank you".

01:03.564 --> 01:05.071
Thank you for every smile.

01:06.386 --> 01:07.650
Thank you for every moment.

01:10.209 --> 01:11.711
Thank you for every memory.

01:14.281 --> 01:18.652
We've achieved everything we ever imagined.

01:20.807 --> 01:21.517
We dreamed.

01:24.372 --> 01:25.276
We dared.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.557
We astonished.

01:30.107 --> 01:32.387
And this is just the beginning of the new world...

01:32.497 --> 01:34.093
...we started making together.

01:35.506 --> 01:40.797
We may have closed our doors but our promise still stands.

01:42.226 --> 01:44.569
Connecting minds, creating the future.
