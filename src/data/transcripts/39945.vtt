00:00.771 --> 00:02.411
It's not a time machine...

00:03.182 --> 00:06.421
...although it has the power to revive history...

00:06.761 --> 00:08.973
...and explore any possible future.

00:09.752 --> 00:12.255
It's not simply a timekeeper, either.

00:12.887 --> 00:15.219
It certainly holds our fondest memories...

00:15.511 --> 00:19.773
...but also our deepest questions about who we are....

00:20.333 --> 00:22.051
...and who we aspire to be.

00:22.729 --> 00:25.194
It's not merely a sign of the times,...

00:25.527 --> 00:28.937
...for it reflects the unalterable passions in our hearts,...

00:29.345 --> 00:31.533
...the constant obstacles on our way,..

00:31.837 --> 00:35.347
...and our willingness to take them on, always.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.610
It's not just 24 frames flickering every second.

00:40.020 --> 00:43.069
It's a testament to what truly moves us,...

00:43.616 --> 00:47.765
...a legacy that lives on, and a quest that knows no end.

00:48.431 --> 00:49.961
A perpetual movement.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.247
It's cinema.
