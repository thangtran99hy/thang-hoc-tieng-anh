00:00.795 --> 00:04.688
The price of just about everything has gone up over the past year.

00:05.930 --> 00:09.409
Bananas will cost you six percent more on average.

00:10.077 --> 00:14.994
Milk, 15% and eggs are 25% more expensive.

00:15.589 --> 00:17.971
It's all part of rising inflation,...

00:18.369 --> 00:23.119
...which hit 8.5% in March, the highest in 40 years.

00:23.511 --> 00:25.108
Why is inflation happening?

00:25.449 --> 00:28.061
It all goes back to supply and demand.

00:28.278 --> 00:32.021
The price of something is a balancing act between these two factors.

00:32.411 --> 00:34.143
Let's take beef, for example.

00:34.633 --> 00:37.993
When COVID struck, meat production slowed dramatically...

00:38.280 --> 00:40.761
...as farmers had to scale their operations.

00:41.439 --> 00:44.071
Transportation costs and a labor shortage...

00:44.397 --> 00:46.337
...has made it even harder to produce beef,...

00:46.521 --> 00:50.011
...reducing supply and raising the price of a pound of steak...

00:50.173 --> 00:51.305
...more than 18%.

00:51.831 --> 00:56.291
The Federal Reserve has started using its main tool to combat inflation,...

00:56.703 --> 00:57.986
...raising interest rates.

00:58.412 --> 01:02.711
Which can reduce demand and bring back the economy into balance.
