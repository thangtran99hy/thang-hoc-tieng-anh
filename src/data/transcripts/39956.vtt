My name is Kengo Kuma; I am an architect based in Tokyo.

00:07.107 --> 00:11.655
I'm always trying to use natural materials as possibly as I can...

00:11.848 --> 00:17.681
...as I want to bring nature back to architectural design.

00:19.371 --> 00:26.167
I also want to reconnect history and the contemporary city.

00:26.687 --> 00:33.308
In the 20th century, history and the contemporary city have very much separated...

00:33.423 --> 00:38.755
...and no connection exists between history and our life,...

00:39.365 --> 00:45.170
...and through designing architecture, it is possible to reconnect history.
