In the morning, a teenager wakes up and uses facial recognition...

00:03.996 --> 00:05.081
...to unlock her phone.

00:05.345 --> 00:08.158
She scrolls through social media feeds to see what's new.

00:08.433 --> 00:10.945
Then, she asks the voice assistant on her phone...

00:11.042 --> 00:12.687
...what the weather's going to be like that day....

00:12.779 --> 00:14.447
...so she knows how to dress for school.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.895
A college student uses an app on his phone...

00:17.982 --> 00:20.101
...to deposit a birthday check from his grandmother.

00:20.404 --> 00:21.710
He takes a photo of the check,...

00:22.007 --> 00:24.244
...and the app automatically reads the handwriting...

00:24.335 --> 00:25.499
...to figure out the amount.

00:26.004 --> 00:27.859
It then deposits in into his account.

00:29.205 --> 00:31.639
Meanwhile, a younger student uses a different app...

00:31.822 --> 00:33.769
...that is teaching her a new language.

00:34.132 --> 00:35.787
The app listens to what she says...

00:35.873 --> 00:38.938
...and can recognize what she's saying even if she makes mistakes.

00:39.337 --> 00:42.676
The app then gives her personalized feedback on her pronunciation.
