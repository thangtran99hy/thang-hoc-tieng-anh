Outsider art is a tricky field to define and sort of quantify.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.746
We tend to define outsider art...

00:10.833 --> 00:13.716
...as art by people who aren't formally trained...

00:13.813 --> 00:16.889
...and who work outside of academic circles.

00:17.187 --> 00:20.897
Sometimes people are kept out of the mainstream art world...

00:21.007 --> 00:23.611
...because of who they are where they live.

00:27.105 --> 00:29.139
One of the great things about outsider art...

00:29.247 --> 00:34.799
...is that you're looking at a lot of artists who drew their inspiration...

00:34.957 --> 00:40.054
...from religion, from popular culture, from general visual culture,...

00:40.415 --> 00:41.800
...from their communities.

00:42.755 --> 00:46.979
It gives us access to understanding a little bit more...

00:47.395 --> 00:51.542
...about what life was like for a lot of these artists.
