00:00.629 --> 00:03.653
In order to solve full self-driving properly,...

00:03.740 --> 00:06.384
...you actually just have to solve real-world AI.

00:08.633 --> 00:12.577
Because you're like, what are the road networks designed to work with?

00:12.843 --> 00:15.996
They're designed to work with a biological neural net, our brains,...

00:16.760 --> 00:19.683
...and with vision, our eyes.

00:20.767 --> 00:25.773
And so, in order to make it work with computers,...

00:25.848 --> 00:30.518
...you basically need to solve real-world AI and vision.

00:31.667 --> 00:38.109
Because we need cameras and silicon neural nets...

00:39.159 --> 00:44.741
...in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed for eyes...

00:44.885 --> 00:46.236
...and biological neural nets.

00:48.403 --> 00:49.296
I guess when you put it that way,...

00:49.367 --> 00:53.056
...it's quite obvious that the only way to solve full self-driving...

00:53.177 --> 00:57.029
...is to solve real-world AI and sophisticated vision.
