Sudha Varghese has devoted her life to serving the women and girls...

00:05.011 --> 00:08.354
...from one of India's lowest castes, the Musahar.

00:09.395 --> 00:13.525
She runs a free girls school, offering lessons in everything...

00:13.629 --> 00:15.265
...from math to karate.

00:16.065 --> 00:20.172
Most importantly, she teaches students to believe in themselves...

00:20.299 --> 00:22.153
...and their potential for greatness.

00:23.813 --> 00:27.433
The Musahar women, they are always told that, you are nobody...

00:28.680 --> 00:30.631
...and they internalized that.

00:31.712 --> 00:37.822
And so, they got marginalized into a community that has no education.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.625
So I started the school for girls.

00:44.829 --> 00:48.630
I wanted to give them not just reading, writing,...

00:48.814 --> 00:50.825
...but I wanted to give them skills,...

00:53.295 --> 00:55.249
...karate to protect themselves.

00:57.215 --> 01:04.129
We also have yoga, sports and singing.

01:07.462 --> 01:10.747
There should be an all-around development for these girls.

01:11.375 --> 01:16.132
They should be able to get in touch with the talents they have.

01:18.605 --> 01:22.163
Our girls can become anybody, in any field,...

01:22.452 --> 01:25.056
...an engineer, a teacher, a doctor.

01:25.818 --> 01:28.063
So once, those aspirations are there,...

01:28.267 --> 01:32.180
...I have full faith that their dreams will become realities.

01:35.114 --> 01:38.405
My struggle, my effort is to give them...

01:38.582 --> 01:41.648
...anything that will help them go ahead.
