00:00.223 --> 00:01.728
Okay, here's probably a good one.

00:03.207 --> 00:04.648
Can you tell Spot what to do?

00:05.118 --> 00:08.093
So, yes, Spot does not have a mind of its own.

00:08.259 --> 00:12.401
You have a controller where you can directly command Spot,...

00:12.497 --> 00:14.033
...kind of like an Xbox controller...

00:14.189 --> 00:16.399
...or you can program it to do an autonomous mission.

00:16.613 --> 00:20.135
But all of these things, you are setting up and defining for Spot.

00:21.630 --> 00:26.132
Can I drive the robot into or over a trash can or a classmate?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.829
It's a great question...

00:28.113 --> 00:34.387
...and we try to bake in obstacle avoidance into our robots...

00:34.977 --> 00:37.394
...from a software and vision perspective.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.530
You know, if a human lays down on the floor and you're not very big,...

00:40.621 --> 00:43.351
...it might think you're a step that it could walk over.

00:43.436 --> 00:44.719
So, I wouldn't say to try that.

00:44.986 --> 00:46.411
Does Spot have a favorite color?

00:47.629 --> 00:49.462
Well, I would like to think that it's yellow,...

00:50.133 --> 00:53.913
...but since robots can't think, I'm just going to decide for it.

00:53.998 --> 00:55.067
Yes, it's yellow.
