00:00.405 --> 00:03.651
Qatar is the smallest country to ever host the World Cup...

00:03.920 --> 00:06.214
...and they're also the first Islamic country to do so.

00:06.327 --> 00:08.832
And while they have huge plans for their tournament,...

00:09.169 --> 00:13.083
...there are also big controversies that are almost impossible to ignore.

00:16.959 --> 00:20.139
The decision to give Qatar the tournament was made in 2010...

00:20.434 --> 00:23.633
...with FIFA saying it would bring new audiences to football.

00:24.091 --> 00:28.385
It was also the day when Russia was handed the World Cup in 2018.

00:28.936 --> 00:31.152
Qatar got 2022.

00:31.869 --> 00:33.737
But people have argued for years...

00:34.155 --> 00:36.557
...as to how legitimate that decision really was.

00:37.158 --> 00:41.258
Qatar always insisted they won it fair and square.

00:44.950 --> 00:46.945
Qatar is a conservative state...

00:47.257 --> 00:49.872
...where homosexuality is still against the law.

00:50.468 --> 00:53.165
The organizers insist that everybody is welcome.

00:53.548 --> 00:56.031
The rainbow flags can be flown in stadiums,...

00:56.538 --> 00:58.795
...but some gay fans just don't want to travel.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.616
There have also been reports of worker rights abuses...

01:01.709 --> 01:03.935
...in the building of stadiums for the tournament.

01:04.219 --> 01:05.855
Just how many workers have died...

01:05.947 --> 01:08.474
...in the construction of these stadiums is disputed.

01:08.892 --> 01:11.010
But all the attention has forced Qatar...

01:11.274 --> 01:14.242
...to improve the conditions and rights of workers.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.219
For the first time ever,...

01:16.302 --> 01:18.201
...the World Cup is being played in the winter...

01:18.446 --> 01:21.675
...because the summertime temperatures here are just too hot.

01:22.190 --> 01:25.703
Temperatures can reach close to 50 degrees Celsius.

01:26.545 --> 01:30.026
It will still be warm, but air conditioning inside these venues...

01:30.187 --> 01:32.893
...will help fans and the players keep cool.

01:34.015 --> 01:35.495
There will be eight stadiums...

01:35.811 --> 01:37.805
...all within an hour's drive of each other...

01:38.345 --> 01:42.063
...so it will feel more like an Olympic Games centered on one city.

01:43.201 --> 01:45.137
Favorites for the tournament include Brazil,....

01:45.320 --> 01:47.725
...reigning champions France and even England,...

01:47.894 --> 01:50.648
...who reached the semifinals in the last World Cup.

01:51.257 --> 01:54.555
But European champions Italy will not be in the tournament...

01:54.872 --> 01:57.303
...after getting knocked out of the qualifying playoffs...

01:57.528 --> 01:58.909
...by North Macedonia.

01:59.437 --> 02:01.447
Another team who won't be there are Russia.

02:01.739 --> 02:05.213
They were removed from the tournament after the country invaded Ukraine.
