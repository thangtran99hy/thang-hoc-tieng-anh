A fruit-based vegan diet is a diet without any animal products whatsoever...

00:04.421 --> 00:06.755
...and consisting of mainly fruit.

00:08.795 --> 00:11.546
900 calories of sugar excellence.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.513
My name is Mikkel and this is my brother Mads; we're from Norway...

00:14.617 --> 00:18.205
...and we eat more fruit in a day than most people do in a month.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.644
We tend to rely heavily on bananas.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.410
So this will probably last us a couple of days.

00:23.565 --> 00:28.118
Every day, I probably go through 15 bananas, maybe 20; it depends on my activity level.

00:28.242 --> 00:30.638
Whether it be a banana or a mango or anything else,...

00:30.724 --> 00:35.225
...every fruit tends to have every single nutrient in different balances.

00:35.779 --> 00:39.485
In my opinion, the ideal diet consists of mainly tropical fruits.

00:39.941 --> 00:41.923
I feel amazing when I'm eating fruit.

00:42.061 --> 00:46.157
I'm actually more satisfied in terms of taste and gustatory experience...

00:46.230 --> 00:47.565
...than I've ever been in my life.

00:48.289 --> 00:50.168
For me, it's not really about an ideology.

00:50.261 --> 00:51.965
It's not really about a religious belief.

00:52.305 --> 00:55.909
What matters more is that we found it and we tried it,...

00:56.067 --> 00:59.340
...and once we tried it, the results spoke for themselves.
