00:01.171 --> 00:07.971
I also am aware that many of our compatriots voted for me today...

00:08.222 --> 00:10.407
...not to support my ideas...

00:11.623 --> 00:16.707
...but simply to build a barricade against the ideas of the far-right,...

00:18.855 --> 00:21.851
...and at this point, I would like to thank them...

00:22.384 --> 00:25.199
...and tell them that I am aware...

00:25.540 --> 00:30.179
...that this vote gives me a great duty for the next few years.

00:30.304 --> 00:33.751
I am the custodian of their sense of duty,...

00:34.079 --> 00:38.169
...their attachment to our republic and the respect for differences...

00:38.771 --> 00:40.976
...which have been expressed over the past few weeks.

00:42.393 --> 00:47.549
I am also thinking about all of our fellow citizens who abstained.

00:49.664 --> 00:50.987
They remain silent...

00:52.521 --> 00:55.023
...and we also need to respond to that decision.

01:00.191 --> 01:04.732
And lastly, I also would like to mention those who voted for Madame Le Pen,....

01:05.040 --> 01:07.491
...and I know how this is going to be this evening.

01:07.837 --> 01:08.161
No!

01:08.457 --> 01:09.949
Please do not boo anyone.

01:11.026 --> 01:13.807
Since the very beginning, I asked you not to boo anyone.

01:21.831 --> 01:31.971
Because from now on, I'm not a candidate anymore.

01:32.703 --> 01:34.864
I'm now the president of everyone.
