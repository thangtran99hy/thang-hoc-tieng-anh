00:00.353 --> 00:04.116
Hidden within the remarkable mountains of the Andes Cordillera in Bolivia...

00:04.347 --> 00:08.009
...lies a mythical passage that has such a deadly reputation,...

00:08.309 --> 00:10.549
...it came to be known as the "Death Road."

00:10.768 --> 00:13.697
Many consider this to be the most dangerous road in the world...

00:13.973 --> 00:17.568
...because of hundreds of traffic accidents in its long history.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.578
Death Road is very narrow...

00:20.899 --> 00:24.137
...and offers barely any space for even compact cars...

00:24.496 --> 00:28.429
...and yet, you'll see mostly trucks and buses plying this route...

00:28.745 --> 00:30.973
...aside from hanging off the edge as you pass through.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.105
The weather around this area is near freezing with high humidity,...

00:35.333 --> 00:39.517
...so the road itself is almost always slippery all year round.

00:40.915 --> 00:44.269
Back in 2007, the road had been improved immensely,...

00:44.549 --> 00:47.095
...hoping to turn its unfortunate reputation around.

00:47.485 --> 00:50.712
Today, the road is a popular tourist destination for anyone...

00:50.782 --> 00:53.229
...looking for a little thrill in their lives.

00:53.481 --> 00:57.036
Not only will you be able to inject a little adrenaline into your system,...

00:57.438 --> 01:00.591
...but you also get to experience a dramatic downhill route...

01:00.727 --> 01:04.263
...through sceneries that are constantly changing before your eyes...

01:04.541 --> 01:08.933
...from lush green forests to glaciers and frozen lagoons.

01:09.090 --> 01:11.635
The abrupt changes are so fascinating...

01:12.110 --> 01:14.242
...and will surely leave you breathless.

01:14.987 --> 01:17.437
Ninety miles off the coast of Santos, Brazil,...

01:17.687 --> 01:19.949
...is a small island with the highest concentration...

01:20.217 --> 01:22.765
...of one of the most venomous snakes in the world:...

01:22.935 --> 01:24.468
...the golden lancehead viper.

01:24.838 --> 01:27.113
Stepping ashore on this uninhabitable island,...

01:27.436 --> 01:31.411
...it's expected that you would see a snake about 10 minutes in.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.598
With overgrown grass all over the island,....

01:33.926 --> 01:37.401
...it'll feel like walking through a minefield of venomous serpents.

01:37.566 --> 01:39.759
The island is generally closed to the public,...

01:40.013 --> 01:42.940
...but there are some exemptions with tourists and scientists...

01:43.241 --> 01:46.474
...who pay the big bucks to experience the island themselves.

01:47.045 --> 01:51.129
With an estimated number of 2,000 to 4,000  snakes on the island,...

01:51.436 --> 01:55.267
...it's important to know that one bite can kill you within an hour.

01:55.587 --> 01:59.123
It's hard to imagine why anyone would willingly visit a place...

01:59.221 --> 02:01.570
...where a painful death may lurk under the grass.

02:01.903 --> 02:05.184
Whether it's for personal experience or monetary incentives,...

02:05.409 --> 02:08.389
...the risk of death is certainly high here.
