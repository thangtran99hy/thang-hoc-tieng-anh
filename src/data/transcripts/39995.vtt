00:00.073 --> 00:02.087
More financial trouble for Russia today.

00:02.169 --> 00:05.081
The credit rating agency, S&P Global, says...

00:05.187 --> 00:07.461
...Russia effectively defaulted on its foreign debt...

00:07.545 --> 00:10.932
...after offering to make payments in rubles instead of dollars.

00:11.284 --> 00:12.463
Matt Egan joins me now.

00:12.541 --> 00:17.455
So Matt, this is a consequence, it seems, of some of the sanctions on Russia,...

00:17.536 --> 00:20.119
...but what are the practical implications for Moscow?

00:21.540 --> 00:23.817
Yeah Dana, this really is all about sanctions.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.863
Russia owed payments on interest, and they owed it in dollars.

00:28.965 --> 00:32.124
But they tried to pay in rubles, not because they don't have dollars.

00:32.241 --> 00:32.716
They do.

00:32.787 --> 00:37.137
They just can't access those dollars because of sanctions from the West.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.477
And so that's why S&P has downgraded Russia...

00:39.553 --> 00:41.443
...into what they're calling "selective default,"...

00:41.535 --> 00:46.521
...which is when a country defaults on specific obligations but not its entire debt.

00:46.940 --> 00:50.945
Now, technically, Russia has 30 days here to make these payments,...

00:51.024 --> 00:55.445
...but S&P does not think that Russia will do so, at least not in dollars.

00:55.512 --> 00:57.828
So, what does this all mean for the economy?

00:57.945 --> 01:02.363
Well, a default would raise borrowing cost for Russia.

01:02.444 --> 01:04.945
Investors are not gonna want to do business with Russia.

01:05.242 --> 01:07.821
And this is also adding to the economic pain there.

01:07.909 --> 01:11.769
They're experiencing very high inflation, shrinking standard of living,...

01:11.859 --> 01:14.375
...and this exodus of Western companies.

01:14.998 --> 01:18.691
And World Bank says that Russia is already in default.

01:18.781 --> 01:23.763
The World Bank expects Russia's GDP to decline by 11 percent this year.

01:23.983 --> 01:25.925
Really significant economic pain there.

01:26.007 --> 01:28.324
But even more pain in Ukraine.

01:28.393 --> 01:31.777
As you can see, the World Bank is expecting that Ukraine's GDP...

01:31.858 --> 01:34.791
...will collapse by nearly 50 percent this year, Dana.
