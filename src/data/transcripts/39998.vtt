00:00.370 --> 00:04.299
We've led hundreds of comprehensive, at scale transformation efforts.

00:04.709 --> 00:05.977
And through these efforts,...

00:06.175 --> 00:08.773
...we've identified four of the most common pitfalls....

00:08.894 --> 00:10.371
...that undermine success.

00:10.638 --> 00:15.528
The first is a failure to set fact based, high aspirations.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.791
Rather than seeking to achieve the potential of their organizations,...

00:20.139 --> 00:21.832
...some leaders aim too low,...

00:22.191 --> 00:25.403
...with a target that simply isn't backed up by the facts.

00:25.791 --> 00:30.018
Second, organizations often fail to attach a compelling "why?"...

00:30.325 --> 00:32.603
...to that new, more aggressive aspiration.

00:33.085 --> 00:35.859
Leaders need to provide all of their employees with a reason...

00:35.992 --> 00:37.880
...why they should do things differently.

00:38.157 --> 00:42.131
A third cause for transformation failure is poor execution.

00:42.860 --> 00:47.145
Too often, managers focus on the activities surrounding the transformation...

00:47.546 --> 00:50.634
...rather than remaining laser-focused on the outcomes.

00:51.245 --> 00:56.179
Finally, organizations often fail to sustain the impact that they've achieved.

00:56.833 --> 00:59.651
Performance disciplines end with the transformation effort,...

01:00.123 --> 01:02.721
...incentives and budgets are not fully aligned with the new objectives,...

01:03.872 --> 01:07.380
...and management teams fail to keep investing in the future,...

01:07.731 --> 01:11.505
...leaving them unprepared for the next horizon or unforeseen headwinds.
