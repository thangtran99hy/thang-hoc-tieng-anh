The 1912 gift of 3,020 flowering cherry trees from the city of Tokyo to Washington...

00:08.077 --> 00:12.857
...was a milestone in the development of relations between the United States and Japan.

00:14.018 --> 00:16.971
It grew into an act of diplomacy and goodwill...

00:17.304 --> 00:21.185
...that would put a lasting mark on the Washington landscape and community.

00:22.185 --> 00:26.599
The idea of planting cherry trees in the city's new Potomac Park...

00:26.741 --> 00:29.275
...had been proposed about 25 years earlier...

00:29.359 --> 00:35.161
...by Washington author, journalist, and world traveler Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore,...

00:35.803 --> 00:41.729
...who became enamored with cherry blossoms during trips to Japan that began in 1885.

00:43.059 --> 00:45.695
The dream finally took root in 1909,...

00:46.075 --> 00:51.483
...when first lady Helen "Nellie" Taft, prodded by a note from Scidmore,...

00:51.787 --> 00:56.133
...took up the project as part of her own plans for developing Potomac Park.

00:56.959 --> 01:01.461
Mrs. Taft replied to Scidmore on April 7, 1909.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.649
"I have taken the matter up and am promised the trees,...

01:05.989 --> 01:09.407
...but I thought perhaps it would be best to make an avenue of them,...

01:09.726 --> 01:12.277
...extending down to the turn in the road."

01:13.337 --> 01:17.096
With support from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki,...

01:17.523 --> 01:22.396
...two thousand trees were shipped to Washington and arrived in early 1910.

01:23.271 --> 01:27.521
Unfortunately, most had to be burned because of infestation.

01:28.477 --> 01:31.669
The Japanese government resolved to send a fresh,...

01:31.800 --> 01:36.611
...even larger shipment of trees that would be free of diseases and pests.

01:37.535 --> 01:41.861
A committee of experts worked closely with Seisaku Funatsu,...

01:42.017 --> 01:46.022
...a cherry tree grower at Tokyo's Arakawa River embankment,...

01:46.425 --> 01:49.688
...to select and raise trees for the second gift.

01:50.653 --> 01:54.288
Funatsu selected twelve varieties of trees,...

01:54.554 --> 01:59.087
...which were grafted to specially selected rootstock and nurtured for a year...

01:59.436 --> 02:05.299
...at the Imperial Horticultural Station of Okitsu before being shipped to Washington.
