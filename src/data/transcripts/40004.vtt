00:06.729 --> 00:10.947
The United States and Japan have been close allies for more than 60 years...

00:11.054 --> 00:15.087
...based on the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security.

00:16.343 --> 00:20.739
Under this treaty, more than 50,000 U.S. military men and women...

00:20.842 --> 00:23.344
...are stationed in Japan at any given time.

00:24.416 --> 00:27.755
They are contributing to global peace and prosperity.

00:30.937 --> 00:35.098
During their time in Japan, U.S. service members and their families...

00:35.266 --> 00:37.302
...create cultural and community ties,...

00:37.559 --> 00:39.358
...and it's the relationship between people...

00:39.697 --> 00:43.326
...that makes the bond between the United States and Japan even stronger.

00:43.573 --> 00:46.346
The best thing about Japan is the people,...

00:47.287 --> 00:50.694
...the respect they give and their culture.

00:50.823 --> 00:52.079
I really enjoy about Japan.

00:52.167 --> 00:55.173
Actually, the number one thing I think I enjoy about Japan are the people.

00:55.270 --> 00:58.690
Coming to Japan, the Japanese people are very accommodating.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.719
They're very nice and you just can't get that anywhere else in the world.

01:02.439 --> 01:05.383
It is always with heavy hearts that the U.S. personnel...

01:05.523 --> 01:07.172
...leave Japan after their missions.

01:07.485 --> 01:12.679
The Japan-US Military Program JUMP provides a powerful foundation...

01:12.944 --> 01:16.873
...to help maintain the personal ties that exist between the two countries.

01:17.656 --> 01:21.547
JUMP stands for Japan-US Military Program for two purposes.

01:21.621 --> 01:24.701
One is to honor American veterans who served in Japan...

01:24.772 --> 01:26.191
...and contributed to the alliance,...

01:26.565 --> 01:30.042
...but also we hope those people who have now returned to the United States...

01:30.311 --> 01:32.121
...will remain connected to Japan.

01:32.298 --> 01:37.956
It's a wonderful program to bring back memories to the Americans,...

01:38.036 --> 01:40.217
...to the military gentlemen that were over there,...

01:40.505 --> 01:42.739
...and to watch the dancers and the drummers...

01:42.835 --> 01:45.155
...and the Japanese food and the friendship,...

01:45.496 --> 01:47.625
...and it just brings back many happy memories.
