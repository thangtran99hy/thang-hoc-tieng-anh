Banksy is very famous for stenciling on very anonymous walls around the world.

00:13.038 --> 00:14.903
And I think this is part of that legacy...

00:15.009 --> 00:18.563
...where he's taking various art historical motifs...

00:18.702 --> 00:21.655
...and kind of inserting himself into that narrative.

00:24.439 --> 00:27.387
Banksy's "Diamond in the Rough" is clearly a contemporary work of art...

00:27.535 --> 00:31.478
...but it shares common elements from Egyptian art.

00:31.829 --> 00:36.397
The vertical panel, the pictorial language and a figure of a girl...

00:36.497 --> 00:40.403
...offering all share characteristics that we see in this ancient culture.

00:40.625 --> 00:46.860
The panel itself has an oval window which is reminiscent of a cartouche...

00:47.025 --> 00:51.187
...which is a pictorial plane that holds hieroglyphs...

00:51.309 --> 00:54.611
...that tell about the Egyptian Pharaoh whose property it is.

00:56.298 --> 00:58.787
There's depth and there's a complexity to it.

00:59.086 --> 01:03.263
Banksy is clearly part of that lineage that Basquiat and Herring...

01:03.363 --> 01:06.913
...kind of established in the early 80s of street art being turned into fine art.

01:07.321 --> 01:08.912
The painting is called "Diamond in the Rough".

01:09.037 --> 01:11.585
So, it's sort of beauty in unexpected places.
