00:00.309 --> 00:02.643
If any of my children would be at a point...

00:02.741 --> 00:05.309
...where they would just be begging me,...

00:05.543 --> 00:07.034
"Why won't you just give up on me?"

00:07.284 --> 00:08.122
I can't.

00:08.783 --> 00:09.903
I don't know how.

00:11.843 --> 00:14.177
There's no manuals for being a mom.

00:14.285 --> 00:14.506
Yeah.

00:14.596 --> 00:16.307
It's like you have to wing it, right?

00:16.779 --> 00:18.347
And it doesn't get easier, you know.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.264
It just gets harder in different ways.

00:22.747 --> 00:23.801
High school was hard.

00:23.947 --> 00:24.707
High school was hard.

00:24.850 --> 00:25.981
Really, really hard.

00:26.251 --> 00:28.541
I know that my mom is always going to be there...

00:28.653 --> 00:31.831
...no matter how much we fight.

00:31.910 --> 00:35.047
It's like, the more we fight, the more we kind of bond a little, I guess.

00:35.130 --> 00:38.613
Oh my gosh, I was so mean to you in high school.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.211
Early middle age was hard.

00:40.357 --> 00:42.420
My girls left at 18 and 19.

00:42.509 --> 00:43.888
They moved far away from me.

00:44.075 --> 00:45.709
Motherhood goes by very fast.

00:45.961 --> 00:48.631
When you hold that little bitty baby in your arms,...

00:48.722 --> 00:50.798
...it's just a love that you can't imagine.

00:50.911 --> 00:54.301
My mom always made things happen for me, no matter what.

00:54.412 --> 00:55.759
Mama was always there.

00:55.886 --> 00:56.899
That's what she gave me.

00:56.972 --> 01:00.894
Never give up on your child, even when they're driving you crazy.

01:00.991 --> 01:02.871
And I want to be that for my girls.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.155
Like, find it.
