Elon Musk has bought Twitter for approximately 44 billion.

00:05.614 --> 00:12.166
He's going to be paying each share of Twitter $54.20.

00:13.061 --> 00:15.218
In a statement released by the company,...

00:15.392 --> 00:19.638
Mr. Musk said, "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy...

00:19.707 --> 00:22.024
...and Twitter is the digital town square...

00:22.561 --> 00:25.969
...where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.

00:26.037 --> 00:27.746
I also want to make Twitter better than ever...

00:27.843 --> 00:29.923
...by enhancing the product with new features,...

00:30.375 --> 00:33.547
...making the algorithms open source to increase trust,...

00:33.664 --> 00:37.748
...defeating these spam bots and authenticating all humans.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.799
Twitter has tremendous potential.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.827
I look forward to working with the company...

00:42.109 --> 00:45.743
...and the community of users to unlock it."
