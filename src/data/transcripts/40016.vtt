Dear mom,...

00:11.201 --> 00:12.906
You taught me so much,...

00:18.345 --> 00:22.921
...that practice makes perfect,...

00:26.398 --> 00:29.494
...and perfect is overrated.

00:31.434 --> 00:34.841
Thank you for holding me when it hurts,...

00:36.439 --> 00:41.757
...sharing your sense of wonder and humor,...

00:43.119 --> 00:49.110
...for knowing when to stay close and when to let me go.

00:50.953 --> 00:53.236
You've always seen my beauty,...

00:53.960 --> 00:58.393
...my hard work and never underestimated...

00:59.397 --> 01:00.363
...what I can do.

01:00.437 --> 01:00.925
Enjoy.

01:05.339 --> 01:09.796
I am who I am because of you.

01:19.657 --> 01:20.817
Happy Mother's Day!
