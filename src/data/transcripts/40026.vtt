Penicillin.

00:01.665 --> 00:03.861
It was discovered totally by accident.

00:04.155 --> 00:07.867
In 1928, Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming...

00:08.161 --> 00:10.934
...left his lab to go on vacation without cleaning up.

00:11.884 --> 00:12.485
When he came back,...

00:12.657 --> 00:16.597
...he found mold had developed on a contaminated sample of staphylococci.

00:16.965 --> 00:20.405
Remarkably, the molds had killed the surrounding bacteria.

00:20.918 --> 00:24.629
He decided to name the substance released from the mold "penicillin."

00:25.381 --> 00:27.425
But what is penicillin exactly?

00:28.020 --> 00:30.209
It is an antibiotic that fights bacteria...

00:30.405 --> 00:32.801
...by stopping the cell wall from renewing during growth.

00:33.268 --> 00:37.157
This weakens the cell wall until it bursts, killing the bacteria.

00:37.839 --> 00:41.019
It wasn't until the 1940s that America and Britain...

00:41.306 --> 00:43.265
...funded the mass production of penicillin.

00:43.712 --> 00:47.693
Hailed as a miracle drug that saved countless lives during World War II,...

00:48.123 --> 00:50.076
...it allowed the Allies to patch up a soldier...

00:50.176 --> 00:52.959
...and have them ready to fight again in a matter of weeks.
