00:00.128 --> 00:02.879
Officials in New Jersey are investigating a possible alarming link...

00:02.961 --> 00:05.705
...between cases of brain cancer and a high school there.

00:06.063 --> 00:10.089
105 former students and staff report being diagnosed with brain tumors...

00:10.165 --> 00:13.242
...going back decades, about half of them cancerous.

00:13.565 --> 00:15.601
Health experts are calling the rate concerning.

00:15.723 --> 00:18.607
Environmental engineers are now testing the grounds for radiation.

00:18.917 --> 00:20.523
Here's ABC's Zachary Kiesh.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.541
Tonight, there are questions surrounding this New Jersey high school...

00:24.653 --> 00:26.860
...and a possible link to brain tumors.

00:27.109 --> 00:27.847
I want answers.

00:27.923 --> 00:31.296
I wanna know that there is something or there is nothing there.

00:31.529 --> 00:36.027
Al Lupiano wondered if there was a possible connection after he, his wife,...

00:36.126 --> 00:40.534
â€¦and his sister Angela, all former students were diagnosed with brain tumors.

00:40.931 --> 00:43.513
Al's tumor was discovered 20 years ago.

00:43.721 --> 00:47.511
His wife and sister received their diagnosis last August.

00:47.731 --> 00:49.421
Angela died this year.

00:49.626 --> 00:52.447
I had recalled two family friends,...

00:52.520 --> 00:56.133
â€¦the Black sisters, had also passed of these brain tumors.

00:57.813 --> 01:00.654
That started setting off bells and whistles in my head.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.181
Lupiano made a plea on Facebook,...

01:03.289 --> 01:07.295
...searching for anyone else in the area who had a similar experience.

01:07.605 --> 01:12.764
So far, 105 former students and staff connected to Colonia High School...

01:12.842 --> 01:16.662
...say they have been diagnosed with primary brain tumors,...

01:16.738 --> 01:18.731
...about half were cancerous.

01:19.048 --> 01:21.351
The cases spanned three decades.
