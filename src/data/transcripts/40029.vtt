My kids are up like roosters at 5 AM, and it's driving my husband and I crazy.

00:06.020 --> 00:09.035
So, we're getting some advice from Dr. Marc Weissbluth.

00:09.635 --> 00:12.025
When children are sleep-deprived,...

00:12.241 --> 00:15.999
...they have more difficulty self soothing themselves back to sleep,...

00:16.193 --> 00:18.299
...so they tend to start the day too early.

00:19.369 --> 00:21.741
Dr. Weissbluth is a kids' sleep expert,....

00:21.879 --> 00:26.077
...who has spent weeks helping us set sleep rules and start a bedtime routine.

00:26.361 --> 00:29.159
And they have worked, as you can see from an earlier video we made.

00:29.887 --> 00:32.096
Leo, why did you get this present?

00:32.175 --> 00:34.305
I slept last night by myself.

00:34.528 --> 00:37.883
But now, we really need the kids to sleep longer in the morning.

00:38.123 --> 00:40.735
Are we putting the kids to bed too early the night before?

00:40.975 --> 00:43.432
Just how much sleep does a little boy need?

00:43.623 --> 00:46.669
There are published guidelines, but the range is wide.

00:46.938 --> 00:51.811
The best answer to that is to look at his behavior around 4 or 5 PM.

00:53.029 --> 00:55.961
In the afternoon, my kids are cranky.

00:56.107 --> 00:57.506
But, isn't that normal?

00:58.326 --> 01:03.291
He's in an awful mood, and he's cranky because he's short on sleep.

01:03.854 --> 01:06.025
When you're short on sleep, when I'm short on sleep,...

01:06.192 --> 01:08.030
...we become a little bit hypersensitive.

01:08.408 --> 01:13.561
What's happened is, if you look at surveys of bedtimes over decades,...

01:13.666 --> 01:15.907
â€¦ten, twenty, thirty years, it's gotten later and later.

01:16.969 --> 01:22.217
Children are having more difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or both,...

01:22.423 --> 01:24.819
...in part, because the bedtime is too late.
