00:01.595 --> 00:02.264
Good morning.

00:03.493 --> 00:04.499
You're up so early.

00:06.352 --> 00:07.977
What time did you sleep last night?

00:14.179 --> 00:15.888
So this is a studio office.

00:16.023 --> 00:18.240
All the extra desks are assigned to his assistants...

00:18.331 --> 00:19.709
...who will be arriving later today.

00:19.841 --> 00:21.748
He built this house about five years ago...

00:21.849 --> 00:24.837
...and had this area designed specifically for his manga studio.

00:24.929 --> 00:26.361
It's a bit nicer and more modern...

00:26.442 --> 00:29.531
...compared to your stereotypical mangaka studio in Japan.

00:30.820 --> 00:34.013
So he creates the manga called "Kanojo, Okarishimasu,"...

00:34.135 --> 00:36.313
...which translates to "renting a girlfriend,"...

00:36.537 --> 00:42.043
...a popular love comedy Rensai in the Japanese weekly Shonen magazine since 2017.

00:42.181 --> 00:44.097
"Rensai" means it's been turned into a comic series...

00:44.180 --> 00:45.601
...in partnership with a publisher.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.129
Most of all, mangaka strive for Rensai status...

00:48.231 --> 00:52.070
...as it signifies that the manga is popular enough for a weekly mass audience.
