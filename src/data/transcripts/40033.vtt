00:00.113 --> 00:01.045
I'm Ash Ketchum.

00:01.345 --> 00:03.493
I came from Pallet Town in the Kanto region.

00:03.799 --> 00:05.993
And this is my good buddy, Pikachu.

00:06.683 --> 00:07.571
Nice to meet you.

00:12.833 --> 00:13.949
Hi, I'm Sarah Natochenny.

00:14.050 --> 00:14.713
I'm a voice actor.

00:14.791 --> 00:17.759
You probably know me best as Ash Ketchum on Pokemon.

00:17.901 --> 00:19.515
I'm also Delia Ketchum,...

00:19.837 --> 00:23.733
...and Staraptor and Misdreavus.

00:24.134 --> 00:27.886
Today, I'm going to be showing you my process for dubbing Pokemon into English.

00:28.481 --> 00:31.654
Pokemon is a show that's originally voiced and animated in Japan.

00:31.870 --> 00:33.285
So when the show comes to me,...

00:33.443 --> 00:35.871
...my job is to reinterpret it for an American audience.

00:35.981 --> 00:38.048
For demonstration, I'm gonna do them together.

00:38.733 --> 00:39.253
Ready for it?

00:39.679 --> 00:40.398
I guess.

00:43.631 --> 00:45.629
Hey Mom, I'm back!

00:46.096 --> 00:47.334
Hope you had fun, Ash.

00:47.690 --> 00:48.650
Sure did.

00:48.809 --> 00:53.577
We went diving with a Sharpedo, saw lots of Pokemon I've never seen before.

00:53.757 --> 00:54.695
Yeah!

00:56.275 --> 00:57.581
And that's how I dub Pokemon.

00:58.013 --> 01:00.169
So because the English dub is so widespread,...

01:00.271 --> 01:02.620
...I'm getting emails from people in India and Bangladesh...

01:02.696 --> 01:04.461
...and Russia and Japan and Brazil...

01:04.699 --> 01:06.446
...thanking me for helping them learn English.

01:06.542 --> 01:07.221
It's amazing.
