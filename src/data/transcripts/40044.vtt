Ed, so this study explains how global warming forces animals...

00:03.629 --> 00:05.901
...to move outside of their typical habitats...

00:06.360 --> 00:09.153
...and then have encounters with different species.

00:09.485 --> 00:13.057
How does this then pose threats to animal and to human health?

00:14.729 --> 00:18.639
So, as you said, animals will be forced to relocate to new places...

00:18.723 --> 00:22.573
...to track the changing climates that we have inflicted upon the planet.

00:23.075 --> 00:26.559
As they do that, species that never previously coexisted...

00:26.646 --> 00:28.900
...will suddenly encounter each other for the first time.

00:29.005 --> 00:32.563
And the viruses that those species uniquely harbor...

00:32.646 --> 00:35.596
...will get chances to jump into new hosts,...

00:35.831 --> 00:41.531
...and that increases the risk of new diseases occurring in not only these animals,...

00:41.616 --> 00:43.967
...but then eventually in ourselves.

00:44.047 --> 00:46.689
The new study that you mentioned shows that these events...

00:46.962 --> 00:51.724
...are happening at an increasing pace, at an alarming degree.

00:51.945 --> 00:52.635
And worst of all,...

00:52.706 --> 00:57.589
...to a degree that is already going on and that may be very difficult to stop.

00:57.697 --> 01:01.964
This is the era that we have found ourselves in through our own actions,...

01:02.033 --> 01:05.481
...one where the risk of pandemics is greater than it was before.

01:05.955 --> 01:07.812
You write that the study simulation,...

01:07.885 --> 01:12.387
…quote, "revealed that million viruses have been dramatically reshuffled..."

01:12.534 --> 01:15.483
"...to a degree that likely can't be undone,..."

01:15.959 --> 01:18.537
"...even if all carbon emissions ceased tomorrow."

01:18.612 --> 01:22.044
At this point then, what can be done to prevent this from getting worse?

01:23.443 --> 01:25.442
Yes, so I mean, firstly, it's worth saying...

01:25.515 --> 01:29.490
...that there are obviously many good reasons to forestall future carbon emissions.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.053
But that's not going to be the thing that stops this process from happening...

01:33.118 --> 01:34.472
…because it's already well underway.

01:34.748 --> 01:36.090
We, therefore, need to prepare.

01:36.163 --> 01:39.242
We need to acknowledge that we live in a future where, sadly,...

01:39.317 --> 01:41.926
...the events of the last three years might well happen again...

01:42.021 --> 01:43.444
…and before we're ready for it.
