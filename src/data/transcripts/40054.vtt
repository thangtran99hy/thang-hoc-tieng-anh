"Poplars on the banks of the Epte, Autumn,"...

00:03.523 --> 00:07.671

Each journey to cross the Atlantic at the turn of the century...

00:17.120 --> 00:20.603
...to sate the pioneering demand for the artist's work in America.

00:22.179 --> 00:26.152
Monet defied the artistic standards and practices of his day.

00:26.787 --> 00:31.613
His signature brush strokes, expressive hues, enriched impasto...

00:32.000 --> 00:38.236

00:40.585 --> 00:44.343
European critics challenged the French painter's innovative technique...

00:44.543 --> 00:46.673
...and radical interpretation of landscape.

01:00.787 --> 01:03.525
...and urged American collectors to take note,...

01:04.539 --> 01:07.445
...but it was the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel...

01:07.625 --> 01:10.649
...who proved the most responsible for Monet's success.

01:11.637 --> 01:15.797
Durand-Ruel became the primary supplier of the artist's work.

01:16.429 --> 01:18.736
And in 1886, the dealer staged...

01:18.843 --> 01:22.779
...the most significant impressionist exhibition of its time in New York,...

01:23.921 --> 01:26.255
...a pivotal moment in Monet's career.

01:27.465 --> 01:31.465
The press declared him the undisputed leader of the new movement.

01:32.328 --> 01:36.562
By 1913, the onetime rebel of the French art world...

01:37.014 --> 01:39.825
...was now the master of modern art,...

01:41.287 --> 01:47.000
...a triumph, a legacy, a foundation for what was to come.
