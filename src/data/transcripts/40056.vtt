00:00.801 --> 00:04.795
If you were to close your eyes and just listen to the sound,...

00:05.073 --> 00:10.693
...could you identify the movie and where we are in the movie?

00:11.381 --> 00:14.516
Everything is just so iconic.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.199
Even just hearing that, you're like, oh, that's Star Wars.

00:21.331 --> 00:22.526
That's totally Star Wars.

00:30.555 --> 00:32.944
This is The Mandalorian, season two.

00:33.505 --> 00:35.674
So here, we have singularly,..

00:35.895 --> 00:38.761
...these sounds making up the sound of the Razor Crest...

00:38.844 --> 00:39.676
...coming in.

00:47.955 --> 00:48.625
Such a nerd.

00:49.204 --> 00:53.840
It's like what I think is a very hilarious metal wobble sound...

00:54.309 --> 00:57.069
...that I will try and put in everything I ever work on...

00:57.235 --> 00:58.474
...because I think it's incredible.

00:59.583 --> 01:00.487
Here it goes.

01:00.832 --> 01:05.171
We see this metal kind of debris kind of spin off.

01:09.475 --> 01:10.301
It's funny, right?

01:11.235 --> 01:16.741
You'll find that also on the speeder chase on Crait in "The Last Jedi."

01:16.921 --> 01:24.284
When Poe puts his foot through the speeder, you can't unhear it.
