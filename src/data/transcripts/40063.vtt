What is this brief mortal life if not the pursuit of legacy?

00:19.875 --> 00:21.362
I, Rickard Stark.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.782
I, Corlys Velaryon.

00:22.975 --> 00:24.327
I, Ormund Baratheon.

00:26.434 --> 00:30.875
I promise to be faithful to King Viserys and to his named heir, Princess Rhaenyra.

00:31.081 --> 00:32.332
Rhaenyra Targaryen.

00:34.622 --> 00:42.566
Men would soon put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.

00:51.059 --> 00:52.325
We play an ugly game.

00:55.257 --> 00:57.301
You have the determination to win it.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.938
History does not remember blood.

01:22.688 --> 01:24.191
It remembers names.
