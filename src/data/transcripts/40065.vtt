00:00.289 --> 00:03.551
This could be the most important minute of your day.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.963
We have been through difficult times...

00:07.039 --> 00:08.428
...and faced big problems ahead.

00:09.652 --> 00:12.999
Every crisis contains both danger and opportunity.

00:14.649 --> 00:15.897
You can play your part.

00:15.987 --> 00:16.715
Right now.

00:16.791 --> 00:17.343
Right now.

00:18.353 --> 00:19.755
Please close your eyes.

00:21.467 --> 00:21.966
Imagine.

00:22.062 --> 00:22.573
Imagine,...

00:22.660 --> 00:24.501
...the better future we could have.

00:24.595 --> 00:25.868
Imagine that future.

00:28.939 --> 00:30.275
What does it look like?

00:30.344 --> 00:30.998
For youth.

00:31.209 --> 00:32.189
For the people you love.

00:32.521 --> 00:34.188
How do we lift each other up...

00:34.370 --> 00:35.462
...and make it fair?

00:36.071 --> 00:37.436
How do we protect nature...

00:37.510 --> 00:39.461
...and save our shared home?

00:40.659 --> 00:42.301
Picture that future you want.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.317
Now open your eyes.

00:50.529 --> 00:53.359
It's time to talk about the future we want.
