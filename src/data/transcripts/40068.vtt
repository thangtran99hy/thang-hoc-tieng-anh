I got married two years ago and now I have twins.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.717
Wow! Twins?

00:05.171 --> 00:06.754
Are they boys or girls?

00:07.109 --> 00:08.371
They are a boy and a girl.

00:08.774 --> 00:09.843
How old are they?

00:10.008 --> 00:11.567
They are six months now.

00:11.807 --> 00:13.814
Oh, I want to see them.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.893
They must be very cute.

00:16.191 --> 00:18.213
Yes, they are just lovely.

00:20.383 --> 00:21.797
Hey, is that a new phone?

00:22.227 --> 00:23.490
You can't buy that yet here.

00:24.139 --> 00:24.979
Where did you get it?

00:25.603 --> 00:26.467
From my brother.

00:26.809 --> 00:27.677
He sent it to me.

00:28.094 --> 00:28.291
What?

00:28.776 --> 00:29.243
Charlie?

00:29.658 --> 00:31.539
No, my other brother, Rob.

00:31.874 --> 00:33.609
He lives in the States, in New York.

00:34.003 --> 00:34.439
Really?

00:34.931 --> 00:36.455
I didn't know you had another brother.
