Welcome to the Meta Store.

00:02.184 --> 00:07.385
It wasn't a huge crowd waiting for the opening of Meta's first physical store.

00:07.602 --> 00:10.159
Still, the enthusiasm was there.

00:10.738 --> 00:17.088
The store is just a stone throw away from the labs developing Meta's virtual reality...

00:17.170 --> 00:19.283
...and augmented reality hardware...

00:19.853 --> 00:22.459
...while showcasing their latest products.

00:22.753 --> 00:27.607
In our store, you'll be able to experience Quest 2, Portal and Ray-Ban stories.

00:28.190 --> 00:35.055
Facebook's parent company intends to examine customers' reactions and expectations.

00:35.466 --> 00:40.860
Meta and its competitors have invested massively in virtual reality hardware,...

00:41.172 --> 00:45.511
...hoping to diversify beyond ads on its sites and apps,...

00:45.834 --> 00:51.072
...which accounted for more than 97% of its revenues in the latest quarter.

00:51.555 --> 00:54.025
The virtual and augmented reality market...

00:54.136 --> 00:59.613
...is expected to hit an annual 500 billion dollars in coming years.

00:59.956 --> 01:06.415
Meta is prepared to lose some 10 billion dollars this year in its Reality Labs...

01:06.609 --> 01:08.121
...to develop that future.
