00:00.102 --> 00:02.477
When Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine,...

00:02.551 --> 00:06.464
...he repeatedly said it was in part a response to NATO's expansion.

00:06.914 --> 00:08.630
Two months on, there's a good chance...

00:08.707 --> 00:13.457
...his invasion will lead to Russia's land border with NATO doubling in length.

00:13.701 --> 00:17.266
Because just as Ukraine borders Russia, so does Finland.

00:17.577 --> 00:19.673
And Finland may soon join NATO.

00:20.215 --> 00:25.232
I won't give any kind of timetable when we will make our decisions,...

00:25.639 --> 00:31.967
...but I think it will happen quite fast, within weeks, not within months.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.275
That's the current Finnish Prime Minister.

00:34.523 --> 00:37.011
This former Prime Minister goes further.

00:37.312 --> 00:41.252
I think that Finland and most possibly Sweden as well,...

00:41.328 --> 00:45.023
...will become members of NATO by the end of this year.

00:45.450 --> 00:47.929
And that would be a moment of huge significance.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.287
NATO is already the world's biggest military alliance.

00:50.379 --> 00:52.089
Its headquarters are in Brussels,...

00:52.335 --> 00:56.147
...and its thirty members include the US, the UK, Germany, and France.

00:56.439 --> 00:57.984
Some other members are in Eastern Europe.

00:58.223 --> 00:59.403
They're here in light purple.

00:59.715 --> 01:04.495
They joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union, much to Vladimir Putin's fury.

01:06.761 --> 01:10.669
We won't move one inch towards the east, they told us in the 1990s.

01:11.398 --> 01:12.307
And what happened?

01:12.857 --> 01:13.920
They deceived us.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.223
They brazenly tricked us.

01:16.536 --> 01:20.063
NATO denies its expansion as a threat, but that's how Russia sees it,...

01:20.305 --> 01:22.777
...and that expansion may be about to continue.

01:23.064 --> 01:26.853
Finland's already a member of the EU, and it cooperates with NATO.

01:27.129 --> 01:31.493
And while it's unofficially neutral in military terms, it is a military player.

01:31.721 --> 01:33.854
Most men in Finland do military service.

01:34.018 --> 01:38.332
Official statistics show a wartime strength of 280,000 soldiers,...

01:38.615 --> 01:40.760
...and 900,000 reservists.

01:41.073 --> 01:45.685
And the Finnish defense forces describe themselves as the "backbone of our society."

01:46.146 --> 01:49.316
Finland's military strategy had felt settled.
