At Stellina's Pizzeria in D.C., the food has been hot,...

00:03.781 --> 00:06.501
...and the tips steady throughout the pandemic.

00:06.838 --> 00:09.475
Have the tips been good during the pandemic?

00:09.746 --> 00:10.850
Oh, for sure.

00:10.966 --> 00:16.219
But now, the staff, suppliers, customers, everyone is facing a tipping point.

00:16.481 --> 00:19.547
And service workers in some places are paying the price.

00:19.721 --> 00:23.075
Just ask Isabella Sarmiento, the Operations Manager.

00:23.226 --> 00:25.645
Tipping has grown a lot more complicated.

00:25.870 --> 00:27.877
It has. You are not wrong.

00:29.707 --> 00:35.187
The pandemic by many accounts pushed tips to new prominence in home deliveries,...

00:35.271 --> 00:38.954
...at take-out stands, food trucks, and in ride-sharing services,...

00:39.286 --> 00:43.137
...far beyond the spots where many consumers were used to seeing them.

00:43.279 --> 00:46.015
At the New York Times, food writer Christina Morales says...

00:46.143 --> 00:51.078
...that's left a lot of folks wondering, where to tip, when, and how much.

00:51.286 --> 00:54.044
What's driving really a lot of this anxiety and confusion,...

00:54.120 --> 00:57.675
...is the fact that these changes in tipping have happened so fast.

00:57.959 --> 01:02.615
She says even the social norms for tipping have become unsettled,...

01:02.925 --> 01:05.623
...noting one company, which tracks credit card transactions,...

01:05.708 --> 01:10.550
...found tips rose as the pandemic began, then leveled off,...

01:10.732 --> 01:14.057
...and now are falling amid the confusion and inflation.

01:14.349 --> 01:18.571
So, should you tip at a coffee stand, a supermarket, a convenience store?

01:18.887 --> 01:19.754
I'm a good tipper.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.071
Some customers say it's simple.

01:22.279 --> 01:24.025
If someone helps you, tip.

01:24.282 --> 01:25.721
If you help yourself,...

01:25.866 --> 01:29.257
I was at the airport, and I grabbed a bottle of water from like a convenience store,...

01:29.350 --> 01:30.549
...and asked me for a tip,...

01:30.947 --> 01:33.727
...and I was like, uh, that's not happening.
