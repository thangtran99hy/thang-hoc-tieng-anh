00:00.127 --> 00:02.173
Wow! You have a big family.

00:03.129 --> 00:04.239
Who are all of these people?

00:04.753 --> 00:06.707
Well, this is my mom...

00:07.019 --> 00:08.092
...and here's my dad.

00:09.083 --> 00:12.083
That's my brother David with his wife and their kids.

00:12.539 --> 00:12.991
They're cute.

00:13.706 --> 00:14.581
How old are they?

00:15.245 --> 00:18.632
Well, Beth is ten and Paul is five.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.342
Do you have any nieces or nephews?

00:21.983 --> 00:22.553
No.

00:23.363 --> 00:24.776
My family is pretty small.

00:25.211 --> 00:29.866
Just me, my mom, my dad, my brother, and my grandfather.

00:30.271 --> 00:32.330
Do you have an aunt or an uncle?

00:32.785 --> 00:33.629
Oh yeah.

00:33.893 --> 00:35.149
I forgot about my uncle.

00:35.966 --> 00:36.967
He lives in Australia.

00:37.297 --> 00:39.287
So, I never get to see him or his family.
