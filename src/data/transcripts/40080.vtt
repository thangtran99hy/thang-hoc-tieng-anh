Just two and a half seconds of distraction can become dangerous on the road.

00:06.465 --> 00:13.509
One Silicon Valley company says it has the solution - a way to be an extra eye for driver,...

00:13.831 --> 00:18.980
...by using cameras, sensors, image recognition software, and real-time alerts.

00:20.088 --> 00:20.694
Distracted.

00:22.347 --> 00:25.715
So we'll alert the driver that he or she is distracted.

00:25.936 --> 00:27.440
Then, the driver's able to look up,...

00:27.698 --> 00:30.059
...maybe notice that traffic has stopped in front of them,...

00:30.905 --> 00:34.137
...slam on the brakes and avoid that very common rear end crash.

00:34.687 --> 00:38.434
Nauto's device sits behind a vehicle's rearview mirror...

00:38.731 --> 00:41.029
...and comes with cameras and other sensors.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.808
So you can see here there's an interior camera that faces the driver,...

00:45.189 --> 00:47.549
...and then an exterior camera that faces the road ahead...

00:48.036 --> 00:50.573
...and we're running algorithms to detect high-risk behaviors.

00:50.830 --> 00:53.875
That behavior could be falling asleep behind the wheel...

00:54.046 --> 00:56.843
...tailgating or checking a cell phone.

00:57.141 --> 01:00.587
It will show a series of progressive alerts based on how distracted they are.
