In the late 17th century, a medical student named Johannes Hofer...

00:04.277 --> 00:08.907
...noticed a strange illness affecting Swiss mercenaries serving abroad.

00:09.457 --> 00:14.979
Its symptoms, including fatigue, insomnia, irregular heartbeat, indigestion,...

00:15.245 --> 00:19.808
...and fever were so strong, the soldiers often had to be discharged.

00:20.428 --> 00:24.217
As Hofer discovered, the cause was not some physical disturbance,...

00:24.457 --> 00:27.255
...but an intense yearning for their mountain homeland.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.118
He dubbed the condition "nostalgia,"...

00:30.355 --> 00:35.289
...from the Greek "nostos" for homecoming and "algos" for pain or longing.

00:35.917 --> 00:40.241
At first, nostalgia was considered a particularly Swiss affliction.

00:40.725 --> 00:45.071
Some doctors proposed that the constant sound of cowbells in the Alps...

00:45.297 --> 00:48.281
...caused trauma to the eardrums and brain.

00:49.081 --> 00:53.551
Commanders even forbade their soldiers from singing traditional Swiss songs...

00:53.854 --> 00:56.869
...for fear that they'd lead to desertion or suicide.

00:57.950 --> 01:03.163
But as migration increased worldwide, nostalgia was observed in various groups.

01:03.669 --> 01:08.202
It turned out that anyone separated from their native place for a long time...

01:08.457 --> 01:10.203
...was vulnerable to nostalgia.

01:10.675 --> 01:12.359
And by the early 20th century,...

01:12.564 --> 01:16.229
...professionals no longer viewed it as a neurological disease,...

01:16.423 --> 01:19.035
...but as a mental condition similar to depression.

01:19.551 --> 01:21.521
Psychologists of the time speculated...

01:21.597 --> 01:24.983
...that it represented difficulties letting go of childhood,...

01:25.382 --> 01:28.304
...or even a longing to return to one's fetal state.
