00:02.950 --> 00:03.575
Open!

00:05.327 --> 00:05.929
Squid.

00:06.462 --> 00:07.387
Octopus?

00:08.284 --> 00:08.886
Either one.

00:09.351 --> 00:11.187
What are these things?

00:11.781 --> 00:12.588
What does it look like?

00:13.669 --> 00:14.821
Suction cups.

00:15.458 --> 00:16.537
Oh my goodness!

00:16.893 --> 00:18.265
Is this the lung?

00:19.703 --> 00:21.821
Didn't that have so many arms?

00:22.008 --> 00:22.776
You mean like this?

00:24.869 --> 00:27.243
Oh my goodness, eww!

00:28.828 --> 00:29.800
What is this?

00:30.001 --> 00:31.659
It's an octopus tentacle.

00:32.382 --> 00:34.223
Oh, but what is this from?

00:35.531 --> 00:36.514
An octopus?

00:37.268 --> 00:39.712
What is that?

00:40.486 --> 00:41.715
That's an octopus tentacle.

00:41.796 --> 00:42.153
Can I see?

00:44.349 --> 00:46.964
I may have octopus finger!

00:47.048 --> 00:48.379
All I'm missing is the face.

00:49.730 --> 00:51.045
This one's chewy.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.011
Too chewy.

00:52.127 --> 00:56.899
In fact, you chew it forever and then you're just going to lose your appetite...

00:57.015 --> 00:57.795
...trying to eat it.

01:01.697 --> 01:03.156
And open!

01:05.093 --> 01:06.391
What are these?

01:06.545 --> 01:09.070
They look like marbles.

01:09.632 --> 01:10.295
Orbeez?

01:11.385 --> 01:12.525
Orbeez and sushi?

01:12.792 --> 01:13.597
What does it feel like?

01:14.631 --> 01:15.580
What the heck?

01:16.395 --> 01:17.986
Oh, fish eggs.

01:19.139 --> 01:21.316
It's popping in your mouth once you bite it.

01:21.651 --> 01:22.758
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

01:23.043 --> 01:25.125
It's a good thing because it's like egg.

01:25.392 --> 01:27.143
Guess what, those are fish eggs.

01:27.626 --> 01:28.336
Fish eggs.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.070
Why did I eat fish eggs?

01:30.973 --> 01:32.629
Because they're so delicious.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.940
I know, but did you cook them?

01:35.517 --> 01:36.175
We didn't.

01:37.124 --> 01:37.934
It's urchin.

01:38.393 --> 01:39.453
Is this alive?

01:39.869 --> 01:40.795
It is not alive.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.144
They smell different.

01:46.355 --> 01:48.660
The sea urchin only uses a spike for defense.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.477
Sea otters use them to protect their babies.

01:51.593 --> 01:53.422
Right now, it would be injecting poison.

01:53.693 --> 01:55.375
Two facts about sea urchins.

02:03.977 --> 02:05.049
Well, that was the last one.

02:05.309 --> 02:08.642
How about a big thing of wasabi to finish us off.

02:18.742 --> 02:19.806
Delicious.
