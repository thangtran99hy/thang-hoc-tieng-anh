Do you know how many cats are slaughtered every year?

00:05.535 --> 00:10.015
Almost 45,000 cats are picked up by shelters...

00:10.117 --> 00:13.813
...and about 20,000 of those cats are slaughtered.

00:14.728 --> 00:15.721
That's sad.

00:17.041 --> 00:21.232
In order to decrease the number of deaths happening every year,...

00:21.493 --> 00:23.827
...you can adopt a cat at a shelter.

00:25.761 --> 00:31.191
Another way to protect these cats is by visiting your local cat cafe.

00:32.081 --> 00:36.799
The money the cat cafe makes goes towards taking care of those cats.

00:37.699 --> 00:39.995
Not only can you protect the cats,...

00:40.148 --> 00:44.741
...you can also pet the cats and play with them while enjoying delicious food.

00:45.309 --> 00:46.311
It's a win-win.
