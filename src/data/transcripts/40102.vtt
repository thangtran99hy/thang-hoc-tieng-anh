00:06.907 --> 00:10.957
On a tiny copper globe created in the early 1500s,...

00:11.226 --> 00:14.007
...the coast of Southeast Asia is marked with a message....

00:14.112 --> 00:19.451
...that has since become iconic: "Here be dragons."

00:20.550 --> 00:23.293
Though the words themselves were actually quite rare,...

00:23.402 --> 00:26.922
...the sentiment was common among medieval European mapmakers,...

00:27.116 --> 00:29.659
...who often scrawled dragons and sea monsters...

00:29.723 --> 00:33.165
...over terra incognita, blank spots on the map.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.431
For thousands of years, people all over the world...

00:36.533 --> 00:38.038
...had made both functional maps,...

00:38.119 --> 00:41.491
...showing trade routes, settlements, topography, water sources,...

00:41.593 --> 00:44.053
...the shapes of coastlines or written directions,...

00:44.379 --> 00:46.589
...and what are known as cosmographies,...

00:46.961 --> 00:49.795
...illustrating the Earth and its position in the cosmos,...

00:50.173 --> 00:54.145
...often including constellations, gods and mythic locations.

00:55.197 --> 00:57.827
From the Middle Ages through the mid-17th century,...

00:58.055 --> 01:00.412
...cartographers in Eurasia and North Africa...

01:00.511 --> 01:04.655
...produced a slew of New World maps with features from both these traditions,...

01:04.937 --> 01:08.045
...often commissioned by rulers and other powerful people.

01:08.254 --> 01:10.933
These maps were meant to depict the world's geography,...

01:11.232 --> 01:14.359
...but not necessarily to be useful for navigation.

01:14.937 --> 01:18.409
And given their maker's incomplete knowledge of the world,...

01:18.755 --> 01:23.842
...they were really hypotheses, some of which have been glaringly disproven.

01:25.564 --> 01:30.024
In medieval Europe, the new vogue began with what were known as "mappae mundi."

01:30.307 --> 01:33.385
Many of these veered closer to cosmographies,...

01:33.574 --> 01:37.647
...featuring the Garden of Eden, or mythical dragons.

01:38.101 --> 01:40.128
They all followed the same format,...

01:40.356 --> 01:43.246
...showing the world's land as one mass divided roughly...

01:43.332 --> 01:46.614
...into the shape of a T and surrounded by a ring of ocean.

01:47.940 --> 01:51.349
Islamic mapmakers also created world maps in this format,...

01:51.635 --> 01:55.871
...emphasizing geographic details over fantastical elements.

01:56.215 --> 02:00.995
One of the earliest and most accurate such maps was created by Ibn Hawqal,...

02:01.312 --> 02:04.116
...whose own travels informed his mapmaking.

02:05.165 --> 02:10.040
In 1154, the King of Sicily commissioned Islamic mapmaker Al-Idrisi...

02:10.125 --> 02:12.525
...to create the Tabula Rogeriana,...

02:12.915 --> 02:17.074
...also known as "A Guide to Pleasant Journeys into Faraway Lands."

02:17.608 --> 02:21.993
This book of maps included a world map based on Idrisi's own travel...

02:22.313 --> 02:24.963
...and interviews with other traders and travelers.

02:25.356 --> 02:28.709
He correctly depicted the world as a flattened sphere,...

02:29.052 --> 02:32.748
...but thought Europe, Asia, and North Africa wrapped all the way around it.
