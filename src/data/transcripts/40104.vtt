Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once.

00:07.167 --> 00:13.573
Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release.

00:14.603 --> 00:20.481
What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release.

00:20.865 --> 00:23.331
You can't carry all things.

00:24.385 --> 00:28.730
Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go.

00:29.688 --> 00:35.963
Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there's more room for them.

00:36.946 --> 00:40.803
Secondly, learn to live alongside cringe.

00:44.143 --> 00:49.661
No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe,...

00:50.535 --> 00:55.126
...you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively..

00:55.312 --> 01:01.148
Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime.

01:01.598 --> 01:05.557
Even the term "cringe" might someday be deemed cringe.

01:06.557 --> 01:10.091
Never be ashamed of trying.

01:11.101 --> 01:14.086
Effortlessness is a myth.

01:14.492 --> 01:18.866
The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date...

01:19.437 --> 01:22.031
...and be friends with in high school.

01:22.724 --> 01:28.383
The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company.

01:29.799 --> 01:33.345
Every choice you make leads to the next choice which leads to the next.

01:33.531 --> 01:37.045
And I know it's hard to know which path to take.

01:37.689 --> 01:40.633
There will be times in life where you need to stand up for yourself.

01:42.259 --> 01:46.158
Sometimes, the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of thought...

01:46.711 --> 01:48.759
...in the name of progress and reform.

01:49.692 --> 01:53.003
Sometimes, the right thing to do is to sit and listen...

01:53.115 --> 01:55.194
...to the wisdom of those who have come before us.

01:55.873 --> 01:57.511
I leave you with this:...

01:58.189 --> 02:02.391
We are led by our gut instincts, our intuition,...

02:02.903 --> 02:06.819
...our desires and fears, our scars and our dreams.

02:08.859 --> 02:13.527
Anyway, hard things will happen to us, we will recover.

02:14.114 --> 02:15.052
We will learn from it.

02:15.891 --> 02:18.589
We will grow more resilient because of it.

02:19.232 --> 02:22.473
And as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing,...

02:23.318 --> 02:29.597
...we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out.

02:30.605 --> 02:33.825
And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works.
