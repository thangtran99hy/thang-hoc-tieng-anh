A lot of times I get asked how I got so lucky...

00:05.345 --> 00:07.587
...and how I was able to start traveling the world.

00:08.531 --> 00:09.664
Are my parents rich?

00:10.551 --> 00:13.183
However, the truth is relatively quite simple.

00:14.191 --> 00:17.334
Two years ago, I made the decision to start chasing my dreams...

00:17.427 --> 00:18.525
...and to never look back.

00:19.161 --> 00:20.464
To not have a plan.

00:21.056 --> 00:23.221
It was not easy and I had many doubts.

00:24.170 --> 00:27.933
I worked many little jobs to save up and eventually I started traveling.

00:28.552 --> 00:31.439
Even though the journey wasn't easy, I never looked back.

00:32.486 --> 00:36.049
And deep down I believed that if there's something you're truly passionate about,...

00:36.391 --> 00:37.408
...nothing should stop you.

00:38.067 --> 00:39.831
And that if you keep chasing your dreams,...

00:40.040 --> 00:42.453
...eventually all the pieces fall into place.
