00:02.992 --> 00:08.345
Zeus became a part of our family because my brother was working with somebody...

00:08.439 --> 00:09.946
...who was breeding Great Danes...

00:10.363 --> 00:18.107
...and ever since I was a little girl, Zeus is very stubborn.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.815
He doesn't do anything unless he wants to.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.307
He is also very laid-back.

00:23.553 --> 00:24.845
He loves everybody.

00:25.267 --> 00:30.991
When he gets excited, it's about ten minutes and he runs around and then he's tired.

00:32.197 --> 00:34.530
His water bowl is the sink.

00:37.624 --> 00:42.457
The only time he's really naughty is, he likes to take food off the counter...

00:42.761 --> 00:44.993
...and he likes to steal the baby's pacifier.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.250
He likes to go on walks around the neighborhood.

00:50.533 --> 00:53.378
He really likes being the center of attention.

00:55.877 --> 00:58.579
Zeus has absolutely changed our family.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.293
He brings so much joy.

01:00.453 --> 01:03.337
He is such a loving, loving dog.

01:03.753 --> 01:09.302
The award for us just really recognizes how special Zeus is.

01:09.550 --> 01:14.028
We get a lot of comments about, "Wow, that's the tallest dog I've ever seen."
