Here in Chanel's Pantin Laboratory,...

00:03.981 --> 00:05.407
...for ten years, we have been studying...

00:05.501 --> 00:08.094
...the mechanism of skin aging called senescence,...

00:09.521 --> 00:13.247
...basing our research on data from 6,000 women around the world...

00:13.517 --> 00:15.960
...and working on 2D and 3D skin models...

00:16.023 --> 00:18.520
...to test the efficacy of our active ingredients.

00:19.959 --> 00:23.204
Senescence is the process by which a cell stops dividing...

00:23.303 --> 00:25.787
...and enters a state of permanent growth arrest.

00:27.889 --> 00:30.706
When these cells are treated with red Camellia extract,...

00:31.114 --> 00:34.553
...their cellular vitality has increased by 67 percent.

00:38.941 --> 00:42.644
Over here, we can see how senescence translates on a tissular level.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.725
When skin is treated with red Camellia extract,...

00:47.075 --> 00:49.225
...its oxidative state is rebalanced...

00:49.299 --> 00:51.577
...for revitalized skin from the inside.

00:54.777 --> 00:56.365
Beauty ahead of time.
