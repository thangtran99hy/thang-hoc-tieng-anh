00:06.976 --> 00:10.273
Imagine that you've been unemployed and seeking work for months.

00:10.984 --> 00:13.142
Government benefit programs have helped you cover...

00:13.219 --> 00:16.837
...rent, utilities, and food, but you're barely getting by.

00:17.405 --> 00:20.181
Finally, you hear back about a job application.

00:20.604 --> 00:24.699
You receive your first paycheck in months, and things seem to be turning around.

00:24.876 --> 00:25.753
But there's a catch.

00:26.249 --> 00:30.305
Your new job pays just enough to disqualify you through the benefit programs...

00:30.502 --> 00:32.543
...and not enough to cover the same costs.

00:32.815 --> 00:35.718
To make things worse, you have to pay for transportation to work...

00:35.939 --> 00:37.695
...and childcare while you're at the office.

00:38.123 --> 00:41.418
Somehow, you have less money now than when you were unemployed.

00:41.731 --> 00:45.176
Economists call this demoralizing situation the "welfare trap",...

00:45.321 --> 00:47.142
...one of the many different poverty traps...

00:47.425 --> 00:49.289
...affecting millions of people around the world.

00:49.679 --> 00:52.781
Poverty traps are economic and environmental circumstances...

00:52.967 --> 00:56.381
...that reinforce themselves, perpetuating poverty for generations.

00:57.027 --> 01:00.089
Some poverty traps are tied to an individual circumstances,...

01:00.247 --> 01:03.028
...like a lack of access to healthy food or education.

01:03.239 --> 01:05.219
Others can affect entire nations,...

01:05.330 --> 01:08.271
...such as cycles of corrupt government or climate change.

01:08.726 --> 01:11.293
But the cruel irony of welfare traps in particular...

01:11.513 --> 01:15.025
...is that they stem from the very policies designed to battle poverty.

01:15.685 --> 01:18.675
Most societies throughout history employed some strategies...

01:18.759 --> 01:21.125
...to help people in poverty meet basic needs.

01:21.424 --> 01:24.924
Before the 20th century, religious groups and private charities...

01:25.117 --> 01:26.534
...often led such initiatives.

01:26.866 --> 01:29.225
Today, these are called welfare programs,...

01:29.381 --> 01:32.437
...and they usually take the form of government-provided subsidies...

01:32.567 --> 01:35.791
...for housing, food, energy, and healthcare.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.879
Typically, these programs are means-tested,...

01:39.171 --> 01:41.992
...meaning that only people who fall below a certain income level...

01:42.163 --> 01:43.535
...are eligible for benefits.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.837
This policy is designed to ensure aid goes to those who need it most,...

01:48.099 --> 01:51.253
...but it also means people lose access as soon as they earn...

01:51.331 --> 01:53.126
...more than the qualification threshold,...

01:53.455 --> 01:54.620
...regardless of whether or not...

01:54.712 --> 01:56.621
...they are financially stable enough to stay there.

01:57.181 --> 02:01.119
This vicious cycle is harmful to both those in poverty and those outside of it.
