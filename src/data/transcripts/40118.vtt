00:08.810 --> 00:10.246
There's a force in the world...

00:12.613 --> 00:26.371
...so powerful, it started movements, ended wars, melted the coldest hearts.

00:27.601 --> 00:28.352
Gentle.

00:30.647 --> 00:34.250
Gentle is something the world can't ever have too much of...

00:36.502 --> 00:40.972
...because it makes us kinder, better people.

00:42.721 --> 00:47.811
Gentle is a sign of strength, not weakness.

00:50.101 --> 00:55.377
And in a harsh world, it's the bravest boldest way forward.

00:57.391 --> 01:04.720
For the life you live, the path you walk, and the legacy you leave.
