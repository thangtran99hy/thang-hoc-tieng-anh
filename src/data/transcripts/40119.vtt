00:01.095 --> 00:04.696
Since the inclusion by the Security Council of child protection...

00:04.808 --> 00:06.854
...in the mandate of peacekeeping operation,...

00:07.095 --> 00:10.442
...tireless efforts of our civilian and uniformed personnel...

00:10.569 --> 00:13.437
...have transformed the lives of countless boys and girls.

00:13.599 --> 00:16.767
Peacekeepers have engaged in in dialogue with parties to conflict...

00:16.954 --> 00:20.244
...to halt and prevent grave violations against children.

00:20.409 --> 00:23.034
For example, in August last year in Mali,...

00:23.211 --> 00:26.679
...action plans were signed with a coalition of our movements...

00:26.897 --> 00:29.963
...to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children.

00:30.121 --> 00:37.425
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, up to 2,500 children, including over 350 girls,...

00:37.614 --> 00:41.831
...were voluntarily released by armed groups in just the past three and a half years...

00:42.051 --> 00:44.165
...as a result of dedicated joint efforts.

00:44.506 --> 00:47.590
Peacekeepers have played a crucial role in helping monitor...

00:47.678 --> 00:50.350
...and report on grave violations against children,...

00:50.605 --> 00:53.480
...and they continue to ensure that child protection aspects...

00:53.590 --> 00:56.388
...are included in peace negotiations and agreement.

00:56.710 --> 00:59.833
The protection of children is at the heart of UN peacekeeping.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.815
Despite the extreme challenges they face every day,...

01:02.988 --> 01:05.867
...our peacekeepers remain determined to play their part...

01:06.054 --> 01:08.971
...in protecting boys and girls affected by armed conflict.

01:09.249 --> 01:10.499
As we look to the future,...

01:10.943 --> 01:14.335
...we should never forget that maintaining peace, security and stability...

01:14.449 --> 01:16.274
...is the best way to protect children...

01:16.469 --> 01:19.295
...and that, in turn, protection of children...

01:19.399 --> 01:22.904
...is essential to building lasting peace and stability for all.
