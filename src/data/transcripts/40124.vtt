00:02.923 --> 00:04.508
When I was twelve years old,...

00:04.667 --> 00:07.043
...someone put my first bat in my hand.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.835
That sealed my fate.

00:16.113 --> 00:20.643
Bats are the most unfairly treated animals on Earth.

00:21.721 --> 00:26.339
Fear, not knowing what treasure they have in their local cave,...

00:26.628 --> 00:32.544
...drives people to dynamite it, to gas them, to all kinds of things.

00:33.401 --> 00:39.375
But bats provide us with many ecosystem services, agricultural pest control.

00:42.344 --> 00:47.138
Each million bats destroy ten tons of insects every night.

00:48.347 --> 00:52.547
If we lose those bats, we would lose the crops in a few months.

00:55.127 --> 00:57.698
They're also promoting the regeneration of the forest...

00:58.069 --> 01:00.865
...by dispersing the seeds over vast, vast areas,...

01:03.034 --> 01:03.994
...and they pollinate...

01:04.455 --> 01:09.437
...a lot of ecologically or economically important species of plants...

01:09.645 --> 01:13.547
...like the agaves that are the source for tequila,...

01:14.194 --> 01:18.737
...which represents for Mexico about three billion dollars a year.

01:19.354 --> 01:22.111
We created a humongous network...

01:22.519 --> 01:26.173
...of privately owned protected areas around the country...

01:26.325 --> 01:31.098
...that today includes about 17% of Mexico's territory.

01:33.353 --> 01:36.707
When I have a bat in my hand and I show it to anybody,...

01:37.157 --> 01:39.609
...you see the change in a flash.

01:40.401 --> 01:44.863
This is exactly what has been driving me for a long, long time.

01:45.527 --> 01:50.777
I am here, at 64, continue to be the same child...

01:50.867 --> 01:52.837
...who had his first bat in his hand.

01:53.248 --> 01:54.945
I will never give up.
