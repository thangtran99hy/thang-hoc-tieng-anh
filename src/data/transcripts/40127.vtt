After school, I like to go on the computer to play my favorite game...

00:06.821 --> 00:08.003
...and chat with my friends.

00:08.607 --> 00:12.123
One day, I got a mean message from one of my friends called Katie.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.360
She said I was stupid for not liking Justin Bieber...

00:15.682 --> 00:17.711
...and she didn't want to be my friend anymore.

00:18.455 --> 00:22.232
I felt really sad because I thought Katie was my best friend.

00:22.994 --> 00:26.687
Mom keeps the computer in the kitchen so she can keep an eye on me...

00:26.984 --> 00:30.007
...and when she saw I was upset, she asked me what was wrong.

00:30.805 --> 00:32.236
I told her what had happened...

00:32.543 --> 00:34.921
...and she was shocked that Katie would say that to me.

00:35.673 --> 00:38.219
Mom called Katie's house and spoke with her mom.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.601
When Katie's mom spoke to her,...

00:40.932 --> 00:44.655
...Katie said she had given her password to some of her other friends...

00:44.859 --> 00:46.413
...so they could use the website.

00:47.456 --> 00:51.753
One girl called Melanie doesn't like me and she had used Katie's password...

00:51.922 --> 00:53.693
...to send me the mean messages.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.020
Katie's mom asked her to change the password...

00:57.313 --> 01:01.176
...and promised that she wouldn't give it out to anyone else ever again.

01:01.949 --> 01:03.302
She said it's really dangerous...

01:03.369 --> 01:05.704
...to give other people any of your passwords...

01:06.205 --> 01:08.035
...because you don't know what they'll do with them.

01:08.837 --> 01:10.545
Melanie's mom got cross with her...

01:10.757 --> 01:13.520
...and she said sorry for sending me the mean messages.

01:13.929 --> 01:16.298
Katie said sorry for giving out her password...

01:16.559 --> 01:19.612
...and I'm really glad we're still friends.

01:21.925 --> 01:24.922
Together, we can make cyberspace a better place.
