iPod is an MP3 music player, has CD quality music,...

00:06.873 --> 00:10.662
…and it plays all of the popular open formats of digital music.

00:12.298 --> 00:13.439
Sure, you recognize that man.

00:13.507 --> 00:17.128
That's the late Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs,...

00:17.213 --> 00:20.349
...introducing the iPod back in 2001.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.257
That is some vintage video there.

00:22.343 --> 00:24.007
Alright, more than twenty years later,...

00:24.088 --> 00:29.990
...the company has announced it is discontinuing the once revolutionary MP3 players.

00:30.361 --> 00:35.885
Apple said Tuesday, the iPod Touch will only be available while remaining stocks last,...

00:35.975 --> 00:37.879
...so act fast if you want to get your hands on one.

00:38.162 --> 00:39.749
This marks the end of an iconic product...

00:39.839 --> 00:43.098
...that ushered in a new era for the music industry and for technology.

00:43.421 --> 00:47.095
Apple consumers will still be able to listen to songs through other devices,...

00:47.392 --> 00:50.225
...including the iPhone, iPad, and the Apple Watch.

00:50.335 --> 00:54.155
CBS News tech reporter Dan Patterson joins us now for more on this.

00:54.409 --> 00:58.530
Dan, frankly, I didn't know they were still making and manufacturing iPods.

00:58.613 --> 01:00.747
But, I guess, you know, first of all, what happened to the iPod?

01:01.177 --> 01:04.461
Well, look, it had a long and storied career,...

01:04.577 --> 01:08.475
…but eventually, those features that were so iconic twenty years ago...

01:08.554 --> 01:11.440
...were just absorbed into other products.

01:11.523 --> 01:16.461
Let's start at the top, the most important feature that it was marketed as: music.

01:16.551 --> 01:20.837
Well, instead of downloading or buying songs for 99 cents a piece,...

01:20.915 --> 01:24.240
...we just stream Apple Music or Spotify.

01:24.473 --> 01:29.037
But the other features, look, I mean, the iPod Touch is really just an iPhone...

01:29.132 --> 01:31.769
...without the SIM card, without the calling ability.

01:32.068 --> 01:36.941
So, Apple could have, in theory, kept it in parity, feature to feature.

01:37.188 --> 01:43.231
But, it really just lost out in terms of popularity to that communication device...

01:43.312 --> 01:48.436
…that we all have in our pocket that Steve Jobs built as three products in one.

01:48.547 --> 01:49.501
That's the iPhone.
