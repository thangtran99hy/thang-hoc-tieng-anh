00:02.355 --> 00:03.979
The one thing we know about the future...

00:04.788 --> 00:09.846
...is we have no idea how we're going to be working in 20 years,...

00:10.100 --> 00:12.115
...10 years, even 5 years.

00:15.261 --> 00:19.019
Charleston East and Bay View represent the first time that we led the concept...

00:19.094 --> 00:21.397
...and construction of our own major campuses...

00:22.007 --> 00:26.297
...and it's an opportunity to rethink the very idea of what an office building is,...

00:26.373 --> 00:28.925
...and rethink what's possible for the industry.

00:32.226 --> 00:35.005
With this shape, we've had people walking by and they're like, "What is this?"

00:35.083 --> 00:35.909
Like, they don't even know it.

00:36.016 --> 00:38.373
It doesn't look like an office building, which is so fascinating...

00:38.449 --> 00:39.365
...because then when you come in,...

00:39.511 --> 00:44.773
...you have no preconceptions of how to work that comes from historic ways of working.

00:44.885 --> 00:49.887
But instead, it's like a canvas of creating new ways of being together.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.237
With these projects, we really thought about people first,...

00:56.076 --> 01:00.515
...using things like healthy materials and air quality.

01:00.833 --> 01:06.511
Everyone has natural light and has thermal, visual and acoustic comfort.

01:07.009 --> 01:09.748
Down on the bottom level is really like the market.

01:10.017 --> 01:12.347
It's where we have our meeting rooms, cafes,...

01:12.427 --> 01:14.959
...where you can connect with your community and collaborate.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.693
And then up here, it's more quiet.

01:17.081 --> 01:20.068
You're really focused on that immediate team.
