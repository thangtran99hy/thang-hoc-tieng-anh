00:00.538 --> 00:01.989
Don't let appearances fool you.

00:02.347 --> 00:04.219
This may look like an average office,...

00:04.467 --> 00:07.323
...and Shigetaka Kurita may look like an average guy,...

00:07.855 --> 00:09.921
...but odds are he's changed your life.

00:10.668 --> 00:12.891
Meet the man behind the emoji.

00:14.371 --> 00:17.132
The first emojis are far from what we use today.

00:17.396 --> 00:22.578
Kurita designed them while working for telecom company NTT Docomo in the 1990s.

00:23.050 --> 00:28.727
Using just a simple 12 x 12 pixel grid, 176 original emojis were born...

00:28.965 --> 00:31.733
...and so was a new form of visual communication,...

00:31.973 --> 00:34.431
...the very first one: a heart.

00:34.799 --> 00:35.885
When you're creating it,...

00:36.147 --> 00:40.307
...do you expect it to ever become such a universal language used by so many people?

00:41.523 --> 00:43.098
No, I didn't think so.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.539
Soon after I made emoji, my mother began using them...

00:46.717 --> 00:50.243
...so I could imagine that emoji would be widely used in Japan,...

00:50.383 --> 00:52.251
...but I didn't think your mom would use it.

00:52.627 --> 00:54.314
It's this universal appeal...

00:54.431 --> 00:58.113
...that landed them in New York's Museum of Modern Art's collection last year,...

00:58.768 --> 01:02.137
...permanently solidifying emoji's place in art history.

01:03.577 --> 01:08.623
So I know emojis now have grown in number, but do you have a favorite emoji?

01:10.806 --> 01:12.823
I love the smile emoji the most.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.833
This facial expression is easy to understand.

01:16.048 --> 01:18.733
I found out once the smile emoji face was made,...

01:18.883 --> 01:21.713
...I could develop other facial expressions from there.

01:21.885 --> 01:24.525
In a way, it was a very important design,...

01:24.611 --> 01:26.728
...and all the people of the world would like it.

01:27.151 --> 01:27.905
I love it.
