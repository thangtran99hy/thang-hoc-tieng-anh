The middle class was once a symbol of the American dream,...

00:05.486 --> 00:10.364
...but the American middle class today paints quite a different picture.

00:10.555 --> 00:11.492
Being middle-class,...

00:11.563 --> 00:14.213
...I feel like you're really just in between a rock and a hard place.

00:14.279 --> 00:16.472
You know, you're in a spot where everyone's like,...

00:16.565 --> 00:18.597
"...Hey, you're doing better than, you know, low class."

00:18.673 --> 00:19.295
"You're doing great."

00:19.381 --> 00:20.280
"You should be fine".

00:20.677 --> 00:23.848
And you're underneath the people who are actually doing fine.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.776
It was at least a secure category.

00:25.891 --> 00:30.119
Your kids would go to a school that you felt at least okay about.

00:30.666 --> 00:33.909
You probably own a car or two and youâ€™d own your own home,...

00:34.042 --> 00:35.886
...and you could pay for your kid's college educations.

00:36.309 --> 00:38.127
So, there are certain kinds of assumptions around...

00:38.201 --> 00:40.903
...being a middle-class person that have sort of shattered.

00:41.203 --> 00:45.261
A survey in 2018 found that a third of middle-income adults...

00:45.373 --> 00:49.187
...don't have $400 to cover an unexpected expense.

00:49.373 --> 00:52.433
In polls, when people are asked about being middle-class,...

00:52.510 --> 00:54.956
...they frequently are less likely to say so,...

00:55.317 --> 00:59.682
...and more people now urge the pollsters to suggest that they're working class.

01:00.087 --> 01:03.804
So, I think that many people who maybe in prior years...

01:04.300 --> 01:05.787
...would have thought of themselves as middle-class...

01:05.865 --> 01:08.078
...now no longer think of themselves that way.

01:08.254 --> 01:11.576
So, when we think about economic status, we think about it as some static,...

01:11.998 --> 01:15.529
...you know, state of the world, that you are either poor or not poor;...

01:15.636 --> 01:16.863
...you're middle-class or you're not.

01:17.421 --> 01:19.869
But in fact, the reality is that many middle-class families...

01:20.129 --> 01:23.106
...will experience one or a few years in poverty.

01:23.351 --> 01:29.273
In fact, most American families will have years where they'll be poor or near poor.

01:29.473 --> 01:31.435
That precarity, that uncertainty,...

01:31.653 --> 01:36.371
...that is now a feature of the middle-class experience for most US families.
