Have you ever thought about the meaning of the Olympic rings?

00:05.027 --> 00:05.984
What is their essence?

00:06.243 --> 00:08.769
In 1912, Pierre de Coubertin...

00:09.073 --> 00:12.591
...developed the symbol of the Olympic Games: Olympic rings,...

00:12.910 --> 00:14.941
...which were approved in 1914.

00:15.237 --> 00:19.085
They made their debut at the Olympic Games in Belgium in 1920.

00:19.624 --> 00:21.645
De Coubertin said that the five rings...

00:21.745 --> 00:23.623
...represent the five parts of the world,...

00:24.090 --> 00:26.391
...which were reviving the spirit of Olympism...

00:26.688 --> 00:29.216
...and were willing to accept healthy competition.

00:29.722 --> 00:32.240
Since then, the symbol of five rings has been present...

00:32.320 --> 00:36.285
...throughout the Olympic attributes, on every medal and each logo.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.371
But what is their essence?

00:38.674 --> 00:43.847
The five interlocking rings colored blue, yellow, black, green and red...

00:44.123 --> 00:46.009
...represents the five parts of the world:...

00:46.242 --> 00:50.205
...America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.090
In the classic version,...

00:52.351 --> 00:55.290
...the Olympic rings must be placed on a white background.

00:55.757 --> 00:58.561
An interesting fact is that the Olympic Charter...

00:58.631 --> 01:00.915
....recognize the importance of the Olympic rings,...

01:01.239 --> 01:04.131
...saying that they represent the union of the five continents...

01:04.413 --> 01:08.254
...as well as gathering of athletes from around the world at Olympic Games.

01:08.529 --> 01:10.953
There's a strict code regarding the use of the symbol,...

01:11.258 --> 01:13.518
...which must befall under any circumstance.

01:14.017 --> 01:18.089
For example, even if the Olympic rings are shown on a black background,...

01:18.305 --> 01:21.722
...the black ring must not be replaced by a ring of another color.

01:22.736 --> 01:26.344
The color combination of the Olympic rings was chosen on purpose.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.109
After all, at least one of the colors is present...

01:29.197 --> 01:31.207
...on the national flag of any country...

01:31.777 --> 01:34.552
...as subtext suggests that athletes from any country...

01:34.653 --> 01:36.375
...can participate in the Olympics.

01:36.747 --> 01:38.719
The main purpose of the Olympic Games...

01:38.815 --> 01:42.999
..is maintaining peace and improving relations between all the countries...

01:43.436 --> 01:45.057
...and the Olympic rings can be considered...

01:45.161 --> 01:47.443
...as symbol of peace throughout the world.
