You might be surprised to find the idea...

00:02.248 --> 00:04.631
...behind the shorter length kilt as we know it today...

00:04.720 --> 00:06.261
...did not originate in Scotland.

00:07.628 --> 00:12.036
The idea actually came from an English Quaker called Thomas Rawlinson from Lancashire...

00:12.190 --> 00:13.688
...back in the 1720s.

00:14.995 --> 00:17.443
Rawlinson thought the great kilt was too much...

00:17.643 --> 00:19.121
...and he decided to split the garment...

00:19.229 --> 00:22.488
...and create one distinct piece running from the waist to the middle knee.

00:23.779 --> 00:25.579
Lo and behold, the small kilt,...

00:25.677 --> 00:29.200
...or in Gaelic, "feileadh beag," pronounced "feela beg", was born.

00:30.415 --> 00:34.235
Rawlinson started wearing the small kilt and so did some of his peers.

00:35.565 --> 00:39.413
Before long, it was adopted by the Highlanders and even some Lowlanders.

00:40.361 --> 00:44.495
The Scottish kilt is bold, unique and unmatched by other garments.

00:45.742 --> 00:49.513
The garment usually wraps around the lower body, usually from the left hip,...

00:49.679 --> 00:53.175
...going around the front, and back around the front again to the opposite side,...

00:53.334 --> 00:54.639
...where it is then fastened.

00:55.863 --> 00:58.662
The kilt goes down from the hip to the middle of the knee.

01:00.102 --> 01:04.061
Moving swiftly on, the modern-day kilt is made of twill woven, worsted wool.

01:05.453 --> 01:08.537
The way it's woven creates a distinctive pattern known as tartan.

01:09.854 --> 01:14.472
Historically, specific patterns were associated with different clans and families.

01:15.773 --> 01:17.485
It wasn't until the Victorian era...

01:17.568 --> 01:21.138
...that specific patterns were systemically recorded and formalized.
