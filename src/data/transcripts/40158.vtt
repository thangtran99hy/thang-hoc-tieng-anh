00:02.705 --> 00:05.325
The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.553
Government is voted into power by the people...

00:07.632 --> 00:08.798
...to act in their interests.

00:09.490 --> 00:11.835
UK is also a constitutional monarchy,...

00:11.955 --> 00:14.716
...although Queen Elizabeth II has limited powers...

00:14.817 --> 00:16.487
...and is politically impartial.

00:17.153 --> 00:19.765
Parliament itself is divided into two houses.

00:20.123 --> 00:22.341
The House of Commons and the House of Lords.

00:22.591 --> 00:26.933
Both make laws, scrutinize government and debate current issues.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.035
The two-chamber system is designed...

00:29.102 --> 00:31.820
...to act as a check and balance for both houses.

00:32.436 --> 00:34.830
The countdown to a British general election...

00:35.062 --> 00:38.399
...starts with the prime minister paying a ceremonial visit to the Queen...

00:38.529 --> 00:40.800
...to formalize the dissolution of Parliament.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.678
This used to be a constitutional recess tea,...

00:43.764 --> 00:45.507
...but is now purely a courtesy call...

00:45.633 --> 00:48.842
...following the introduction of fixed-term parliaments in 2011.

00:49.567 --> 00:53.094
A political party that wins an overall majority in the House of Commons...

00:53.378 --> 00:58.223
...with 326 seats or more at a general election forms the new government...

00:58.524 --> 01:00.581
...and its leader becomes prime minister.

01:00.965 --> 01:02.440
If there's no clear winner,...

01:02.607 --> 01:06.143
...one of the two biggest parties, Conservatives or Labour,...

01:06.469 --> 01:09.733
...could make a formal deal with a smaller party or parties,...

01:09.974 --> 01:13.891
...such as the Liberal Democrats or the Eurosceptic UKIP Party.
