It's an honor to meet you, Mr. President.

00:03.189 --> 00:04.125
Well, welcome to the White House.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.405
Come on up here, guys.

00:06.794 --> 00:08.401
This is an important month here in America.

00:08.933 --> 00:13.684
A lot of our Asian-American friends have been subject to real discrimination.

00:14.341 --> 00:16.972
Hate only hides.

00:17.177 --> 00:21.801
When good people talk about it and say how bad it is, it goes down.

00:22.175 --> 00:22.858
So, thank you.

00:23.151 --> 00:28.023
We want to say thank you, sincerely, for your decision...

00:28.699 --> 00:33.124
...such as signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.

00:33.397 --> 00:36.004
So, we just want to be a little help...

00:36.097 --> 00:42.642
...and we truly appreciate the White House and the government's trying to find solutions.

00:42.897 --> 00:44.705
People care a lot about what you say,...

00:45.452 --> 00:47.786
...and what you're doing is good for all people.

00:48.085 --> 00:52.585
It's not just your great talent, it's the message you're communicating.

00:53.479 --> 00:54.420
It matters.
