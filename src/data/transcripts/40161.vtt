"Goodnight Moon" by Margaret Wise Brown.

00:03.689 --> 00:05.992
Pictures by Clement Hurd.

00:06.878 --> 00:09.947
In the great green room, there was a telephone and a red balloon...

00:10.585 --> 00:18.199
...and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon.

00:18.429 --> 00:21.718
And there were three little bears sitting on chairs.

00:24.226 --> 00:26.467
And two little kittens and a pair of mittens.

00:27.091 --> 00:28.345
And a little toy house.

00:28.982 --> 00:36.275
And a young mouse and a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush.

00:36.371 --> 00:39.355
And a quiet old lady who was whispering "hush."

00:43.774 --> 00:44.997
Goodnight room.

00:49.725 --> 00:51.063
Goodnight moon.

00:51.873 --> 00:53.825
Goodnight cow jumping over the moon.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.862
Goodnight light and the red balloon.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.287
Goodnight bears and goodnight chairs.

01:05.121 --> 01:07.546
Goodnight kittens and goodnight mittens.

01:08.782 --> 01:11.613
Goodnight clocks and goodnight socks.

01:15.351 --> 01:18.317
Goodnight little house and goodnight mouse.

01:22.151 --> 01:24.743
Goodnight comb and goodnight brush.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.921
Goodnight nobody, goodnight mush.

01:36.817 --> 01:39.836
And goodnight to the little old lady whispering "hush."

01:44.800 --> 01:47.095
Goodnight stars, goodnight air.

01:51.351 --> 01:53.631
Goodnight noises everywhere.
