MIT is a very fun place to be at.

00:07.662 --> 00:09.295
I am Yoruba.

00:09.486 --> 00:13.885
That's the tribe in Nigeria that I'm from, and our language is very rhythmic.

00:13.983 --> 00:15.155
It's very tonal.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.462
And here there's a group called Rambax.

00:17.821 --> 00:19.619
It's a Senegalese drum ensemble.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.784
It's an education in the type of culture...

00:21.865 --> 00:24.673
...that you find in very many places on the continent.

00:24.897 --> 00:29.166
I took it as a class, and just the rhythms and the beats...

00:29.276 --> 00:33.155
...and the presence of everybody learning the same bax together,...

00:33.351 --> 00:34.878
...nobody drums in isolation.

00:35.305 --> 00:35.455
Right?

00:35.552 --> 00:37.453
You're always looking at the person beside you...

00:37.542 --> 00:39.077
...because you're trying to stay in rhythm,...

00:39.530 --> 00:42.674
...and I saw this also in lab projects with other peers.

00:42.929 --> 00:45.648
There's this sense that you check in with everybody around you...

00:46.091 --> 00:47.635
...as a community, as a team,...

00:47.875 --> 00:50.980
...and make sure that you're all moving towards your goal together.
