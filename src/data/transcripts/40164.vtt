Hi everyone who is learning English with EnglishCentral.

00:11.649 --> 00:16.336
My name is Ah Lau and I'm the goalkeeper for Albirex Niigata Singapore FC.

00:16.588 --> 00:19.417
Today, I will introduce you one football term.

00:20.052 --> 00:21.921
Check out this video for the moment.

00:22.514 --> 00:26.304
The keeper catches a long ball kicked by the opposing team.

00:26.786 --> 00:29.479
At this moment he says, "keeper!"...

00:30.015 --> 00:33.151
...to let his teammates know that he is going to catch the ball.

00:33.885 --> 00:34.657
Keeper!

00:34.974 --> 00:37.773
You have to say it loudly so that everyone can hear you.

00:39.032 --> 00:41.737
All goalkeepers, please try to use this word.

00:42.015 --> 00:42.835
See you soon.
