Hello everyone who is learning English with EnglishCentral.

00:11.827 --> 00:12.855
My name is Ah Lau.

00:13.147 --> 00:16.162
I'm the goalkeeper for Albirex Niigata FC Singapore.

00:16.405 --> 00:17.688
What I would like to talk about today...

00:17.784 --> 00:20.861
...is the characteristic of Japanese people's English.

00:21.593 --> 00:23.695
I have been playing for Albirex for four years...

00:23.898 --> 00:26.727
...and have spent many time with Japanese players.

00:27.008 --> 00:29.652
I would like to talk about what I felt in that time.

00:30.365 --> 00:34.029
So when the Japanese players, all the staff and coaches say that...

00:34.273 --> 00:37.288
"Please come to the stadium at 4:30 P.M."

00:37.603 --> 00:38.943
So I would correct them.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.531
If you use a different term like...

00:41.816 --> 00:45.729
"Please report to the stadium at 4:30 P.M." instead.
