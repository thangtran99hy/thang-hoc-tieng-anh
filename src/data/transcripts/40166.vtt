00:00.683 --> 00:01.414
As you walk in,...

00:01.512 --> 00:07.020
...you're faced primarily by these three very large, very strong paintings...

00:07.298 --> 00:08.827
...and they are extraordinary.

00:09.523 --> 00:13.286
Cy Twombly painted these with paintbrushes on sticks...

00:13.644 --> 00:14.879
...dipped in acrylic red paint.

00:15.030 --> 00:19.690
He then goes at these large canvases in a big performative sense...

00:20.003 --> 00:21.497
..and that's what gives these paintings...

00:21.599 --> 00:25.021
...a sense of great swirling vortex of energy...

00:25.803 --> 00:30.393
...and you have this red on a slightly more fleshy, more ochre base.

00:30.969 --> 00:33.017
There's no bright white canvas here.

00:33.331 --> 00:34.355
It's quick drying.

00:34.825 --> 00:39.479
So those big circles, those spirals is drying at a rate,...

00:39.566 --> 00:43.881
...which allows it to also become a picture of the activity.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.201
By the time you get to the top of the canvas,...

00:47.397 --> 00:48.968
...it's almost like fireworks.

00:49.352 --> 00:50.124
They're up there.

00:50.201 --> 00:52.196
There's a kind of pyrotechnics.

00:53.837 --> 00:59.746
It perhaps shows you a sort of unbridled, possibly destructive...

00:59.966 --> 01:02.473
...and possibly quite lethal side to Bacchus.

01:03.155 --> 01:08.111
The freedom to paint without limitations, without restrictions...

01:08.226 --> 01:10.360
...really comes across in these works.
