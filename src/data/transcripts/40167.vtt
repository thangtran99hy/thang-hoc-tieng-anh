00:01.847 --> 00:03.131
Did you just arrive?

00:03.794 --> 00:05.287
We got here on the 3rd.

00:05.807 --> 00:07.440
And do you plan to stay long?

00:08.143 --> 00:08.752
Yes.

00:08.983 --> 00:10.994
We're not leaving until the end of the month.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.559
The 31st?

00:12.871 --> 00:13.545
That's right.

00:17.276 --> 00:19.177
When are you going on vacation, Nick?

00:20.035 --> 00:21.758
We're leaving on August 16th.

00:22.312 --> 00:23.623
And when are you coming back?

00:23.957 --> 00:25.322
On August 23rd.

00:25.636 --> 00:28.580
Oh no, that means you'll miss my party on the 22nd.

00:29.062 --> 00:29.775
What do you mean?

00:29.974 --> 00:31.566
I'll be back before the 27th.

00:32.367 --> 00:35.126
I said the 22nd, not the 27th.

00:35.795 --> 00:37.417
But maybe I can change the date.

00:37.803 --> 00:39.261
Are you free on the 31st?
