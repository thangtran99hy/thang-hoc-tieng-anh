Hey Christa, have you seen my notebook?

00:02.937 --> 00:03.917
It's on the shelf.

00:04.557 --> 00:05.183
Which shelf?

00:05.430 --> 00:06.851
The shelf beside the wall.

00:07.615 --> 00:08.962
I didn't see it there.

00:09.289 --> 00:11.069
It must be under a pile of paper.

00:11.518 --> 00:12.741
Pile of paper?

00:13.167 --> 00:16.394
Yeah, it's under the pile of paper beside the printer,...

00:16.679 --> 00:18.197
...on the shelf beside the wall.

00:19.021 --> 00:21.830
Beside the printer, under a pile of papers.

00:22.526 --> 00:23.559
I'll check again.

00:24.461 --> 00:25.550
I saw it there.

00:25.781 --> 00:27.266
Look under the flower vase.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.105
Okay, thank you.
