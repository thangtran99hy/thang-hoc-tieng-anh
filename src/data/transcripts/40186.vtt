Hi, Zack.

00:01.431 --> 00:02.118
Oh hey, Jamie.

00:02.217 --> 00:03.456
Are you going back to the office?

00:03.667 --> 00:04.103
Yeah.

00:04.889 --> 00:06.027
And you're coming back here, right?

00:06.279 --> 00:06.533
Yeah.

00:07.313 --> 00:08.909
Could you bring my big red notebook?

00:09.121 --> 00:10.006
Big red notebook?

00:10.642 --> 00:10.848
Yeah.

00:11.218 --> 00:11.595
Sure.

00:11.783 --> 00:12.288
Where is it?

00:12.823 --> 00:14.005
It's inside my drawer.

00:14.281 --> 00:14.787
Okay.

00:15.311 --> 00:18.120
Or maybe on the table inside the meeting room.

00:18.506 --> 00:18.943
Okay.

00:20.051 --> 00:22.722
Okay, so when you enter the meeting room,...

00:22.883 --> 00:24.829
...you will see a round white table.

00:25.471 --> 00:26.599
My notebook is on it.

00:26.905 --> 00:27.938
Round white table.

00:28.346 --> 00:28.765
Okay

00:29.493 --> 00:33.433
And, my red notebook is under a black notebook on the table.

00:33.762 --> 00:35.845
Under a black notebook on the table.

00:36.214 --> 00:36.605
Okay.

00:37.046 --> 00:37.415
Yeah.

00:38.005 --> 00:42.045
I think it's on the table, but it might be inside my drawer,...

00:42.817 --> 00:44.639
...or on the shelf near the door.
