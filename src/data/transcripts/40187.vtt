Have you seen my tumbler?

00:01.613 --> 00:04.014
It's on your table, a little behind your laptop.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.892
How about my earphones?

00:07.560 --> 00:08.793
Have you also seen them?

00:09.433 --> 00:13.403
Maybe they are in the blue box under a book and some papers on your shelf.

00:14.122 --> 00:14.803
Oh, no.

00:14.957 --> 00:15.287
Wait.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.236
They're under your computer screen.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.296
Great.

00:18.529 --> 00:19.118
Thanks, Anna.

00:19.390 --> 00:19.997
You're welcome.

00:20.223 --> 00:21.945
I hope you find all of them on your table.
