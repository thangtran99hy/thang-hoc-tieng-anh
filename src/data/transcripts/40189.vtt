00:00.500 --> 00:02.377
Turkiye, not Turkey.

00:02.599 --> 00:06.124
This English language campaign announced it to the world.

00:09.125 --> 00:12.473
But why abandon a name that's been around for 100 years?

00:12.921 --> 00:14.747
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan...

00:14.874 --> 00:17.297
...said the move was to best represent the country.

00:18.175 --> 00:23.135
But some say the change is to distance the country from links to the bird,...

00:23.469 --> 00:26.435
...as well as the alternative dictionary definition...

00:26.729 --> 00:29.070
...of something that "fails badly."

00:29.224 --> 00:34.198
The association with the bird genuinely annoys Erdogan and the people around him.

00:34.650 --> 00:38.063
It's not a surprise, given the government's sensitivity...

00:38.293 --> 00:42.827
...to how the country's perceived and fondness for nationalist rhetoric.

00:43.043 --> 00:47.201
That, of course, is at the very center of this policy as well.

00:47.447 --> 00:52.537
Their claim is that, the word "Turkiye" conveys Turkey's eternal spirit...

00:52.660 --> 00:55.245
...more than the English word.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.294
As Turkey bids to expand its international footprints...

00:59.435 --> 01:02.754
...from military operations to popular TV series,...

01:02.994 --> 01:06.711
...the government has become increasingly image conscious.

01:07.089 --> 01:12.361
This is part of the new, confident, powerful Turkey in their imagination.

01:12.622 --> 01:17.749
They really want to make a push for new Turkey on the international stage,...

01:17.877 --> 01:19.901
...and this is part of that package.
