00:06.727 --> 00:10.043
As you step into the forest, pause.

00:11.005 --> 00:12.124
Still yourself.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.989
The forest captivates the imagination,...

00:24.103 --> 00:27.520
...permeates into the myths and beliefs of every culture.

00:31.261 --> 00:35.071
There are trees standing to this day that sheltered our ancestors from the rain...

00:35.157 --> 00:39.411
...as they shared their stories and fires 5,000 years ago;...

00:41.111 --> 00:45.642
...trees that have stood through the rise and fall of empires and civilizations.

00:47.923 --> 00:51.464
Forests measure the passing of the year with vibrant green growth,...

00:52.327 --> 00:55.094
...the fall of leaves orange and brown.

00:56.986 --> 00:59.320
They live on as generations come and go,...

01:00.023 --> 01:02.450
...waiting as the world changes all around.

01:04.257 --> 01:08.510
But the heart of the forest beats slowly, unchanging.

01:15.507 --> 01:18.337
Walk into a forest today anywhere in the world...

01:19.162 --> 01:22.920
...and share the same quiet awe that others experience.

01:25.095 --> 01:27.089
We are connected to forests.

01:29.874 --> 01:31.899
We must look after their future.
