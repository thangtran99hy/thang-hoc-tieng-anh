00:00.033 --> 00:01.021
Oh, there we go.

00:01.990 --> 00:03.229
Vincent the painter.

00:04.525 --> 00:08.114
Hi, my name is Sheldon Clarke, and I work in the Security Department...

00:08.207 --> 00:09.689
...here at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:09.967 --> 00:11.519
My name is Anny Aviram.

00:12.103 --> 00:14.052
I'm a Senior Paintings Conservator.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.229
I'm Cara Manes.

00:15.302 --> 00:18.399
I'm an Associate Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture.

00:18.495 --> 00:19.439
I'm Robert Kastler.

00:19.521 --> 00:21.735
I'm the Director of Imaging and Visual Resources.

00:21.835 --> 00:24.151
And today, we're going to be talking about Starry Night.

00:29.212 --> 00:34.173
The Museum of Modern Art developed this partnership with the Lego team...

00:34.296 --> 00:39.332
...trying to reimagine this iconic painting as a Lego set.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.753
Honestly, I knew nothing about Starry Night or Vincent...

00:43.867 --> 00:45.245
...before I started working here.

00:45.383 --> 00:48.373
And I remember the first time I stood at the painting.

00:48.645 --> 00:52.379
First of all, I was so amazed at the reaction of the public.

00:52.463 --> 00:56.737
There's always a group of people just fighting to just look at it,..

00:56.805 --> 00:58.594
...to take pictures, to take selfies.

00:59.056 --> 01:03.167
And I was just curious to know who is this painter...

01:03.252 --> 01:07.055
...and why is everyone so excited to see this piece?

01:10.959 --> 01:13.163
Vincent van Gogh is a Dutch artist.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.475
He was born in the Netherlands in 1853.

01:16.685 --> 01:20.788
He started painting in his late 20s, eventually moved to Paris,...

01:21.374 --> 01:23.608
...started studying these impressionist artists.

01:23.909 --> 01:28.215
Traditionally, artists had measured success by their ability...

01:28.305 --> 01:33.205
...to capture the illusion of reality on a two-dimensional surface.

01:33.657 --> 01:38.625
Van Gogh and his colleagues at the end of the 19th century...

01:39.153 --> 01:46.879
...really started questioning whether the goal of a painting should be to reflect reality.

01:47.885 --> 01:54.393
Van Gogh painted Starry Night when he was in a self-imposed exile.

01:55.203 --> 02:00.531
The artist had a mental break and decided to commit himself to the asylum...

02:00.631 --> 02:03.438
...where he stayed for approximately one year.

02:03.915 --> 02:07.851
He would spend time looking out of the window of his room,...

02:08.001 --> 02:12.565
...which is ostensibly the view that we're seeing in Starry Night.

02:13.135 --> 02:16.149
I think that that's what makes the painting so radical.

02:16.723 --> 02:20.405
While what you're seeing is recognizable, it looks like a landscape,...

02:20.747 --> 02:23.883
...but in fact, it is a portrait of an inner landscape.
