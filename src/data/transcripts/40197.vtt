00:00.663 --> 00:01.689
Have you seen my wallet?

00:02.445 --> 00:03.613
Isn't it in your bag?

00:03.932 --> 00:04.423
No.

00:04.965 --> 00:05.897
Oh, here it is!

00:06.000 --> 00:06.984
It was in my drawer.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.122
Now, where are my glasses?

00:09.787 --> 00:12.308
I think I saw it on the table, beside your books.

00:12.665 --> 00:13.221
I see.

00:13.657 --> 00:14.925
I'll go see if it's there.

00:15.371 --> 00:17.023
I'm also looking for my watch.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.093
Have you seen it?

00:18.841 --> 00:21.795
It's also on the table, above your brown book.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.639
Wait, which table are you talking about?

00:25.473 --> 00:26.926
The table beside your drawer.

00:27.783 --> 00:29.638
The one that has a flower vase on top.

00:30.395 --> 00:32.702
There are books on the table, beside the flower vase.

00:33.290 --> 00:35.380
And your watch is on one of the books.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.113
Your eyeglasses are beside the brown book.

00:38.411 --> 00:38.957
I got it.

00:39.183 --> 00:39.972
Thank you, Ron.
