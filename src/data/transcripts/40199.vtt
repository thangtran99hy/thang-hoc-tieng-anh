They say innovative companies start in the garage.

00:03.920 --> 00:04.701
True story.

00:04.783 --> 00:06.739
Hey, Mercedes, show me what you got.

00:07.063 --> 00:08.227
Are you sure you can keep up?

00:08.321 --> 00:09.685
Well, let's try.

00:10.599 --> 00:12.230
All right, follow me.

00:13.145 --> 00:13.935
Okay.

00:14.373 --> 00:15.299
I'm impressed!

00:17.327 --> 00:19.591
That's what I call aerodynamics.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.252
Pretty mind-blowing.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.529
That's nothing.

00:23.626 --> 00:24.827
It's enough for me.

00:26.923 --> 00:27.647
What a move!

00:28.477 --> 00:29.099
Are you good?

00:29.331 --> 00:29.753
Sure.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.797
But what's that?

00:30.987 --> 00:31.678
Diamonds.

00:31.771 --> 00:33.206
You are thinking small.

00:33.333 --> 00:33.985
Pixels?

00:34.560 --> 00:35.288
Think bigger.

00:35.415 --> 00:37.385
Okay, that's really big.

00:40.049 --> 00:41.595
Hey, Mercedes, watch out.

00:43.630 --> 00:44.430
Well detected.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.369
Those lights are pretty smart.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.691
All right, let's move on.

00:53.209 --> 00:53.395
Miss?

00:53.871 --> 00:54.529
Not today.

00:56.248 --> 00:57.009
Sorry, guys.

00:57.106 --> 00:58.157
I guess she's fine.

00:58.397 --> 00:59.094
Not today?

01:01.293 --> 01:02.925
Is that what I think it is?

01:04.549 --> 01:05.257
Thanks, door.

01:05.382 --> 01:06.343
It really is.

01:09.489 --> 01:12.399
With that range, it's going to be a long ride.

01:12.517 --> 01:13.581
Time to recharge.

01:14.437 --> 01:16.189
Hey, Mercedes, do you mind if I drive?

01:16.502 --> 01:17.133
You wish.

01:17.217 --> 01:17.691
That's true.

01:20.905 --> 01:23.085
Now that's electric.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.243
Come on.

01:24.529 --> 01:25.332
It's magic.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.307
Nice garage, by the way.
