Farmers.

00:02.001 --> 00:03.987
They have an interest in sustainability,...

00:04.417 --> 00:06.737
...but what's been lacking historically for growers...

00:06.849 --> 00:09.017
...is having the data and the tools that they need...

00:09.083 --> 00:10.287
...to be able to do that well.

00:11.125 --> 00:13.918
And that's the reason we're so excited to work with farmers,...

00:14.083 --> 00:16.007
...to give them the guidance that will help them succeed.

I'm Tyler.

00:17.691 --> 00:18.095
I'm Adam.

00:18.357 --> 00:19.993
And we're the co-founders of Agrology.

00:21.565 --> 00:23.467
We started Agrology in 2019.

00:24.331 --> 00:25.683
We've been kicking around the idea...

00:25.791 --> 00:27.603
...of how do we use a lot of different sensors...

00:27.695 --> 00:29.239
...and machine learning and sensor fusion...

00:29.451 --> 00:31.451
...to deliver predictive insights to our growers...

00:31.526 --> 00:32.749
...to thrive in a changing climate.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.642
Traditionally, growers, they try to use predictions themselves,...

00:36.725 --> 00:39.525
...but they can't be on every inch of every farm every day.
