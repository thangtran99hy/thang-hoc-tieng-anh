McDonald's is selling its business in Russia in response to the war in Ukraine.

00:04.872 --> 00:09.209
Burger chain said it wasn't consistent with its values to continue operating there.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.773
McDonald's temporarily closed all its Russian outlets in March.

00:12.859 --> 00:15.175
The BBC's Russian editor Steve Rosenberg says...

00:15.261 --> 00:17.024
…it's very much the end of an era.

00:18.173 --> 00:24.036
Well, McDonald's had temporarily shut its restaurants across Russia back in March.

00:24.108 --> 00:27.400
That's when a lot of international companies and global brands...

00:27.739 --> 00:29.601
…had suspended their operations.

00:29.753 --> 00:32.043
The fact that McDonald's has now come out and said,...

00:32.479 --> 00:35.323
…"look, that's it, we're selling up, we're pulling out."

00:35.672 --> 00:39.615
I think that is recognition of the reality, really,...

00:39.709 --> 00:42.547
…that things are not going to return to normal here,...

00:42.854 --> 00:45.549
…that what the Kremlin calls its "special military operation",...

00:45.678 --> 00:48.050
…what most of the world calls Russia's war,...

00:48.382 --> 00:50.298
…has changed things long term.

00:50.554 --> 00:53.161
So, McDonald's issued a statement in which it said that,...

00:53.537 --> 00:56.482
…owning a business in Russia was no longer tenable...

00:56.573 --> 00:59.172
...or consistent with McDonald's values.

00:59.538 --> 01:01.777
Now, this really is the end of an era.

01:01.860 --> 01:05.429
I remember when the first McDonald's restaurant opened in Russia,...

01:05.750 --> 01:09.055
…way back in 1990, back in the USSR.

01:09.393 --> 01:11.640
There was such excitement, such huge crowds.

01:11.861 --> 01:13.727
I had to queue for three hours to get in.

01:14.090 --> 01:18.371
And I remember that day, American burgers and fries and pies,...

01:18.602 --> 01:20.576
…they really were a symbol that day,...

01:20.678 --> 01:23.333
…of Moscow embracing the West, you know,...

01:23.461 --> 01:26.312
…fast hot food to help end the Cold War.

01:26.718 --> 01:29.558
But fast forward 32 years, things have changed.

01:29.659 --> 01:33.561
And basically Russia and the West have lost their appetite for one another,...

01:33.849 --> 01:35.761
…because Russia's offensive in Ukraine,...

01:36.003 --> 01:38.602
…has sparked international condemnation and sanctions,...

01:38.997 --> 01:42.105
…and the Kremlin accuses the West of threatening Russia.
