00:01.805 --> 00:05.651
It's exciting to really change the aesthetics of technology.

00:07.017 --> 00:10.945
If you think about it, people today have to sort of almost choose...

00:11.047 --> 00:13.532
...between aesthetics and beauty and technology.

00:13.673 --> 00:15.862
Those are orthogonal directions.

00:16.235 --> 00:18.959
What's happening now is these two worlds are coming together.

00:19.283 --> 00:21.836
And this class is preparing students...

00:21.911 --> 00:25.612
...to be able to combine the world of aesthetics,...

00:25.717 --> 00:30.045
...specifically expressive fabric, construction and design,...

00:30.351 --> 00:33.205
...and the world of devices and computation.

00:34.426 --> 00:36.531
Fabrics almost mimic materials...

00:36.635 --> 00:41.197
...in a way  where you have various different length scales that all come together...

00:41.426 --> 00:43.855
...to create your overall structure and your final product.

00:44.433 --> 00:47.743
The biggest thing with textiles is that a lot of times,...

00:47.961 --> 00:49.569
...all the different fibers in your clothes...

00:49.675 --> 00:53.307
...are just made of single fiber, maybe there's, like polyester and cotton mixed together.

00:53.411 --> 00:56.561
But at the smallest scale, just that individual strand of fiber,...

00:56.698 --> 00:57.857
...it's just one material.

00:58.035 --> 00:59.807
The meaning of fabrics is changing.

01:00.035 --> 01:04.629
Now, for the first time in history, the fabric is going to be a computer.

01:04.876 --> 01:07.153
The fabrics are going to do for us everything...

01:07.275 --> 01:09.520
...that our smartphones are doing and a lot more.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.546
And the reason they could do a lot more...

01:11.816 --> 01:14.377
...is because they really cover the surface of our body.

01:14.693 --> 01:18.273
And if you want to really understand your health better...

01:18.460 --> 01:21.303
...and get early warnings of changes in your health,...

01:22.041 --> 01:26.931
...we've just published some work on fabrics that could help listen, to help hear;...

01:28.985 --> 01:30.973
...people that have impairments in hearing,...

01:31.298 --> 01:33.431
...fabrics that could listen to the unborn.

01:33.715 --> 01:36.424
And so what we're doing is converting the fabric...

01:36.569 --> 01:38.629
...from just being what it has always been...

01:38.853 --> 01:42.773
...to something that plays a very meaningful role in our lives.
