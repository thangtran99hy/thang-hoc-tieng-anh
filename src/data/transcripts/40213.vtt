00:00.083 --> 00:02.003
We'll cast your mind back to February last year...

00:02.067 --> 00:03.591
…and you may remember the excitement,...

00:03.685 --> 00:07.381
…when NASA successfully landed its Perseverance Rover on Mars.

00:07.513 --> 00:11.339
Well, it's been busy for the last 15 months or so doing plenty of roving.

00:11.777 --> 00:14.171
And now it's ready for the most important part of the mission,...

00:14.321 --> 00:15.809
…searching for signs of life.

00:16.038 --> 00:18.481
Our science editor, Rebecca Morale, has the details.

00:20.077 --> 00:23.653
The parachute has deployed and we are seeing significant deceleration.

00:23.993 --> 00:27.193
It's a mission that began with a jaw-dropping descent,...

00:27.521 --> 00:30.319
…beaming back real footage of a Mars landing,...

00:30.701 --> 00:34.759
...as NASA's Perseverance Rover was lowered onto the Martian surface.

00:35.294 --> 00:39.052
Over the last year, it's revealed the planet as never seen before,...

00:39.286 --> 00:41.186
…taking some selfies along the way.

00:41.866 --> 00:45.160
It's been busy trundling across the dusty terrain.

00:46.211 --> 00:48.854
And it's made history by flying a helicopter,...

00:49.177 --> 00:51.331
…the first powered flight on another planet.

00:52.159 --> 00:56.196
Now, Perseverance is ready to begin the most important part of its mission,...

00:56.347 --> 00:58.035
…hunting for signs of life.

00:58.411 --> 01:01.910
And it's reached an area where it has the best chance of finding it.

01:02.565 --> 01:05.573
I have been staring at this delta for years now,...

01:06.791 --> 01:08.149
…mostly in orbiter images,...

01:08.517 --> 01:11.366
…and now we're finally right in front of it, seeing it,...

01:11.485 --> 01:12.719
...through the eyes of the rover.

01:12.974 --> 01:15.959
We know there was once liquid water on the surface of Mars.

01:16.293 --> 01:19.389
We know there are organics on the surface of Mars,...

01:19.806 --> 01:22.945
…and so all signs point to the surface of Mars,...

01:23.427 --> 01:25.366
…three and a half to four billion years ago,...

01:25.465 --> 01:26.901
…being a habitable planet.
