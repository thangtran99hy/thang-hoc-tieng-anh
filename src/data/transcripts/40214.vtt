Former president Donald Trump's Truth Social site,...

00:03.331 --> 00:05.395
…has yet to generate any ad revenue.

00:05.467 --> 00:09.194
Yeah, that's according to a new regulatory filing for the business,...

00:09.287 --> 00:12.791
…the platform's parent company Trump Media and Technology Group,...

00:12.951 --> 00:14.511
...is also losing money.

00:14.838 --> 00:19.273
Truth Social is now hoping, that posting exclusive content and messages...

00:19.363 --> 00:23.909
…from the former president could help attract users and book some ad sales.

00:24.338 --> 00:27.733
CBS news tech reporter Dan Patterson joins us now for more on this.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.181
Hey, Dan great to see you.

00:29.268 --> 00:30.779
So, what are some of the factors,...

00:30.881 --> 00:35.630
…playing into why Truth Social has not had any paid advertisers yet.

00:35.831 --> 00:39.729
Well, as we know, in television and on social media,...

00:39.850 --> 00:43.206
...one thing that advertisers love is an audience.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.684
And look, it's really hard to sell ads,...

00:46.767 --> 00:49.769
…if there are no users on a social media site.

00:49.897 --> 00:53.789
And however you feel about the president's politics,...

00:53.881 --> 00:57.320
...there's no users or very few users on Truth Social.

00:57.515 --> 01:00.831
In fact, other right leaning social media sites like Parler and Gab,...

01:01.155 --> 01:04.533
…far exceed the number of users on Truth…

01:04.624 --> 01:07.856
…and those sites have a hard time attracting a user base.

01:08.285 --> 01:12.429
Dan, this regulatory filing flagged former president Trump's previous record,...

01:12.509 --> 01:13.683
…with running businesses noting,...

01:14.012 --> 01:17.822
…that a number of those associated with him have gone bankrupt.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.896
So, what could that mean for the future of this venture,...

01:21.009 --> 01:23.312
…or at least the president's involvement in it.

01:23.513 --> 01:28.136
Uh, well... look, if he is able to exclusively post here,...

01:28.213 --> 01:31.475
...it could attract very hardcore users.
