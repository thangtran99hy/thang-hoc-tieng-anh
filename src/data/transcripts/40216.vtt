00:00.041 --> 00:03.203
I was six years old when I started figure skating.

00:03.485 --> 00:07.071
It was really hard to just spin and just skate,...

00:07.184 --> 00:11.697
...so I fell a lot, but I'd still think it was really fun.

00:12.264 --> 00:16.558
Young You is a three-time South Korean national figure skating champion.

00:17.062 --> 00:20.688
She was just 11 years old when she won the title for the first time,...

00:21.106 --> 00:23.209
...making her the youngest in history.

00:23.594 --> 00:27.305
She also qualified for the Winter Olympics in 2018.

00:27.661 --> 00:31.261
When I was 14, I qualified in the Olympics,...

00:31.458 --> 00:35.581
...but I was too young to compete in the Olympics, sadly.

00:39.613 --> 00:41.798
Young You has a rigorous training schedule,...

00:41.929 --> 00:43.519
...which has her traveling the globe.

00:43.901 --> 00:47.589
I trained in Colorado, in Japan and Korea.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.127
I'm now working on my triple axel.

00:52.288 --> 00:56.767
Triple axel is spinning in the air like three and a half rotation.

00:56.937 --> 01:00.486
That is the hardest jump in the triples.

01:00.960 --> 01:05.929
After that, I'm working my quad style with the harness.

01:06.141 --> 01:10.489
The quad style is turning in the air four rotations,...

01:10.647 --> 01:14.747
...so it's the hardest jump that I'm doing.

01:18.439 --> 01:20.655
Being a figure skating champion is hard work,...

01:21.055 --> 01:24.380
...but Young You is motivated by the support of her family.

01:24.971 --> 01:30.503
Sometimes, I'm not good as usual, but my mom supports me and gives me love,...

01:30.656 --> 01:34.584
...so it helps me, and all my families are...

01:34.744 --> 01:38.179
...cheering me up and makes me do more hard work.
