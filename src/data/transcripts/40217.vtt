00:01.686 --> 00:03.238
March 1963.

00:04.350 --> 00:06.790
The CIA is planning to kill Fidel Castro...

00:06.871 --> 00:08.574
...using his greatest guilty pleasure:...

00:10.096 --> 00:10.945
...a milkshake.

00:14.644 --> 00:17.265
The U.S. feared Castro's anti-American views.

00:17.446 --> 00:19.053
And according to Castro's bodyguard,...

00:19.297 --> 00:22.855
...the CIA plotted 638 times to sabotage him,...

00:23.222 --> 00:25.585
...trying things like chemical powder on his boots,...

00:25.828 --> 00:30.542
...a bacteria-lined scuba suit, spiked cigars and exploding cigars.

00:31.395 --> 00:34.228
But the closest the CIA came to killing Castro?

00:34.647 --> 00:37.993
Poisoning his chocolate milkshake at his favorite ice cream parlor.

00:39.163 --> 00:41.633
The dictator had an obsession with dairy.

00:41.890 --> 00:44.056
Ice cream, milkshakes, you name it.

00:44.272 --> 00:46.320
I mean, it gets hot in Cuba.

00:47.151 --> 00:50.167
So the CIA convinced mafia members to carry out the plot.

00:50.411 --> 00:53.174
The mobsters delivered a pill containing poison to a waiter...

00:53.456 --> 00:55.847
...who had slipped the capsule into Castro's milkshake.

00:56.439 --> 00:59.259
The waiter placed the pill in the freezer until the time was right,...

01:00.159 --> 01:02.133
...but the pill froze to the freezer's lining...

01:02.260 --> 01:04.097
...and when he went to pick it up, the pill ripped open,...

01:04.245 --> 01:05.694
...spilling poison everywhere.

01:06.309 --> 01:08.561
So the would-be assassin waiter abandoned the plot.

01:09.245 --> 01:10.527
The mission was a bust.

01:12.410 --> 01:15.561
Castro went on to become one of the world's longest ruling leaders,...

01:15.871 --> 01:16.898
...arrogantly boasting,...

01:17.067 --> 01:19.916
..."If surviving assassination attempts were an Olympic event,...

01:20.301 --> 01:21.617
...I would win the gold medal."
