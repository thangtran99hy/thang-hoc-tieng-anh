00:00.243 --> 00:02.396
So where did fencing come from?

00:03.007 --> 00:06.575
An early form of fencing for sport can be traced back to ancient Egypt.

00:07.099 --> 00:10.305
The fencing as we know it today derive from the European duel.

00:11.292 --> 00:14.545
The design of swords evolved from a defense and hunting strategy...

00:14.675 --> 00:16.621
...of cutting and slashing to thrusting...

00:16.883 --> 00:18.971
...because it was far more deadly and effective.

00:19.295 --> 00:22.975
The foil is the lightest of the three fencing weapons,...

00:23.073 --> 00:25.522
...and it appeared around 17th century Europe...

00:26.062 --> 00:28.471
...as a practice weapon for the small sword,...

00:28.849 --> 00:32.840
...a fashionable weapon often used in a duel to settle disputes.

00:33.623 --> 00:38.234
Around this time, fencing schools were established in Italy, Spain and France,...

00:38.314 --> 00:42.665
...elevating the practice to a form of art and exercise.

00:43.135 --> 00:45.193
Foil fencing rules are the most limiting.

00:45.478 --> 00:49.471
You can only hit the torso and back and only with the tip of the foil blade.
