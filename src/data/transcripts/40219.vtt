00:01.184 --> 00:02.516
In the 19th century,...

00:02.605 --> 00:05.544
...a sturdier weapon called the epee was introduced.

00:05.685 --> 00:09.075
I would say for a first-time viewer of fencing,...

00:09.175 --> 00:11.435
...the easier one to see is epee.

00:11.707 --> 00:14.059
That's because it's the slowest of the three events...

00:14.147 --> 00:16.492
...due to the whole body being a target area.

00:16.979 --> 00:19.469
Fencers are more hesitant to initiate an attack,...

00:19.775 --> 00:22.318
...exposing their whole body to their opponent.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.914
It is also the only of the three weapons...

00:25.012 --> 00:27.816
...where the right of way rule is not enforced.

00:28.347 --> 00:29.437
What's the right of way?

00:30.017 --> 00:31.469
Well, in a classic duel,...

00:31.545 --> 00:34.799
...the only way to win if you're being attacked is to parry...

00:34.892 --> 00:37.786
...or deflect your opponent's weapon and then riposte...

00:37.879 --> 00:39.115
...or attack your opponent.

00:39.398 --> 00:42.480
With the epee, simultaneous hits can occur...

00:42.587 --> 00:44.669
...and both fencers will receive a point.

00:46.290 --> 00:49.059
And now the fastest event, the sabre.

00:49.288 --> 00:52.967
The sabre is the second fastest sport in the Olympic Games...

00:53.065 --> 00:54.385
...after the rifle shooting.

00:54.536 --> 00:57.953
That means the blade is moving almost as fast as a bullet.

00:58.711 --> 01:00.169
Instead of just thrusting,...

01:00.383 --> 01:03.344
...the sabre fencers can score on any part of the upper body...

01:03.430 --> 01:05.086
...with slashes and thrust.

01:05.426 --> 01:07.169
And because the right of way is enforced,...

01:07.253 --> 01:10.641
...sabre fencers are more incentivized to attack first.
