Hi everyone who is learning English with EnglishCentral.

00:12.168 --> 00:13.050
My name is Fairoz.

00:13.175 --> 00:15.725
I'm a forward for Albirex Niigata Singapore.

00:16.396 --> 00:18.916
Today, I would like to introduce about Singapore football.

00:20.058 --> 00:22.019
First of all, the weather.

00:23.081 --> 00:24.887
The weather is very humid in Singapore.

00:25.241 --> 00:30.020
It's very hot and our matches on the weekend would be 5:30 onwards.

00:30.194 --> 00:33.735
So, on the first half, you're gonna be in hot weather.

00:34.092 --> 00:37.057
Maybe, the second half, from 6 PM onwards,...

00:37.148 --> 00:40.596
...it will be a nice, cooling weather, a little bit, for the weekend.

00:41.091 --> 00:44.323
For weekdays, it's gonna be good weather; it's cooling.

00:45.396 --> 00:49.959
It's a little bit humid, but it's gonna be a little bit hot, I should say.

00:50.649 --> 00:56.805
So second of all, the rules and regulations for our Singapore Premier League.

00:57.565 --> 01:03.769
First of all, most of the clubs will need under 23 below to play in a match,...

01:04.395 --> 01:06.561
...and the rest will be overage.

01:07.591 --> 01:10.820
So, the next one, on the third, I would like to say about the NS.

01:10.964 --> 01:15.744
Usually, some of them having NS, some of them part-time,...

01:15.923 --> 01:19.835
...some of them schooling, some of them working full-time.

01:20.104 --> 01:23.583
So there's a lot of commitment outside,...

01:25.119 --> 01:27.292
...at least, before they come for training.

01:27.505 --> 01:30.860
Some of them can make it, some of them cannot make it for the day,...

01:31.448 --> 01:34.265
...so the coach has to organize the training...

01:34.349 --> 01:37.953
...and they have to text all the players whether you can make it for today's training.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.944
Whoever comes to Singapore,...

01:41.329 --> 01:44.499
...please come and watch the Singapore Premier League football matches.
