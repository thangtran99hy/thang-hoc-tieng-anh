00:00.567 --> 00:02.208
We are doing all we can, of course,...

00:02.297 --> 00:04.563
...to meet our needs, to foster our interests,...

00:04.790 --> 00:07.239
...and also to accommodate the will of the wider world.

00:07.642 --> 00:10.361
As I said before, we are an example in the eyes of the world...

00:10.437 --> 00:12.393
...when it comes to an environmental agenda.

00:13.206 --> 00:15.637
Brazil is a wonderful place, magnificent people...

00:16.342 --> 00:19.402
...and because of the vibrant, inclusive democracy...

00:19.531 --> 00:21.785
...and strong electoral institutions,...

00:22.555 --> 00:25.333
...our nations are linked by deeply rooted, shared values...

00:25.483 --> 00:29.967
...that unlocks incredible opportunities for both our nations in my view.

00:30.887 --> 00:33.284
This year, we will be having elections in Brazil...

00:33.401 --> 00:35.125
...and we do wish to have honest, clean,...

00:35.317 --> 00:38.322
...transparent, auditable and reliable elections.
