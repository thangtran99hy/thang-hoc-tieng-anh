Even though dad and I love having fun,...

00:04.117 --> 00:04.801
Hello, Mr. Lee.

00:05.011 --> 00:07.723
...he is always busy with his work.

00:10.043 --> 00:13.679
As a big guy, dad  is serious sometimes.

00:14.049 --> 00:15.057
And even more...

00:15.411 --> 00:16.068
Finish all your food.

00:16.705 --> 00:17.535
Don't be picky about it.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.475
He is kind of fierce.

00:19.575 --> 00:21.325
Hey, don't always play games.

00:21.571 --> 00:22.590
You guys are not kids anymore.

00:23.713 --> 00:29.723
Dad always works too late to ensure that we have a better life.

00:32.675 --> 00:38.438
So on this birthday, we wanted to do something special...

00:39.434 --> 00:42.924
...to thank you for always being there for us.

00:44.959 --> 00:49.388
You are our superhero, our shelter and protector.

00:51.257 --> 00:55.249
We are able to thrive and grow because of you.

00:56.554 --> 01:01.867
You have no superpowers, yet you always give us the best you can.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.327
Hello, daddy.

01:04.660 --> 01:05.407
I'll be home late.

01:05.677 --> 01:06.233
Okay.

01:06.393 --> 01:08.370
So you guys go ahead and meet without me.

01:08.653 --> 01:09.321
Okay.

01:11.439 --> 01:11.963
Alright.

01:20.579 --> 01:22.482
Happy birthday!

01:25.651 --> 01:28.140
Dad, thanks for being our hero.

01:31.443 --> 01:34.047
You are the greatest gift in our life.

01:36.483 --> 01:38.088
We love you.
