00:00.487 --> 00:02.087
It's a game changing deal.

00:02.371 --> 00:05.923
I'm just so incredibly proud of what we've achieved.

00:06.173 --> 00:09.874
In a new contract, U.S. soccer women and men's player association's,...

00:09.955 --> 00:13.087
...agreeing to equal pay for all players.

00:13.288 --> 00:16.002
This is just a really historic moment,...

00:16.847 --> 00:20.313
...that will hopefully lead to meaningful changes and progress,...

00:20.386 --> 00:23.099
...not only here at home in the U.S., but around the world.

00:23.349 --> 00:27.973
Both men and women will now get around $450,000 a year,...

00:28.122 --> 00:30.486
...commercial and event revenue will be divvied up.

00:30.893 --> 00:35.070
The team's also shaking hands on sharing World Cup prize money,...

00:35.219 --> 00:38.451
...a first of any soccer organization in the world.

00:38.781 --> 00:41.548
That part of today's agreement is especially notable.

00:44.093 --> 00:48.192
As the women's team clinched the last two World Cups, four overall.

00:48.471 --> 00:50.152
The men haven't won yet,...

00:50.263 --> 00:52.752
...but were still making more money just for playing.

00:53.212 --> 00:56.591
The women's 2015 win netted less than two million dollars,...

00:56.690 --> 00:58.962
...while the men made more than five million dollars,...

00:59.046 --> 01:01.845
...losing in the round of 16 the year before.

01:02.245 --> 01:07.181
That propelled a movement for equal pay captured in the CNN film LFG.

01:07.337 --> 01:09.175
We heard people chanting.

01:09.399 --> 01:13.580
Equal Pay! Equal Pay! Equal Pay!

01:13.836 --> 01:14.725
Oh my gosh.

01:15.186 --> 01:16.557
That's when I felt the movement.

01:16.655 --> 01:17.885
Equal Pay!

01:18.155 --> 01:23.121
All right, it's not just us but, it looks as if the world is on our side.
