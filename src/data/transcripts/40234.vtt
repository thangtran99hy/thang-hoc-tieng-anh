00:00.608 --> 00:02.289
Your office looks really nice.

00:02.688 --> 00:03.595
Where do you work, Mary?

00:04.113 --> 00:05.823
I work in a building downtown.

00:06.149 --> 00:09.418
It's in the city center, so it can be really busy outside.

00:09.937 --> 00:10.719
How about you?

00:10.920 --> 00:11.688
Where do you work?

00:12.311 --> 00:14.013
I work in a quiet part of town.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.459
It's outside the city, but it's very near our house.

00:18.001 --> 00:20.570
Do you work with some of your friends in the neighborhood?

00:20.990 --> 00:21.473
Yes!

00:21.681 --> 00:23.273
I work with my best friend here,...

00:23.694 --> 00:25.753
...but I'm actually moving to the city next month.

00:26.183 --> 00:26.628
Are you?

00:27.183 --> 00:27.423
Yes.

00:27.550 --> 00:31.150
I will be transferred to a different department, and their office is in the city.

00:31.772 --> 00:32.565
Have you been there?

00:33.346 --> 00:34.592
I have been there once.

00:35.037 --> 00:38.381
It's a huge space, and the design is very modern.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.677
There must be a lot of people working there.

00:41.260 --> 00:43.995
There are five departments and each has their own room.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.753
I heard there are three conference rooms,...

00:46.947 --> 00:49.447
...a huge common space, and a cafeteria.

00:49.929 --> 00:50.691
I see.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.983
Well, we should meet when you move to the city.

00:53.204 --> 00:53.707
Sure!
