Welcome to our office, Mr. Jones.

00:03.647 --> 00:04.997
Thanks for having me, Karina.

00:05.362 --> 00:07.129
The office looks great!

00:07.372 --> 00:09.871
It's quite small, but it is very comfortable.

00:10.621 --> 00:12.869
So, is this your reception area?

00:13.319 --> 00:14.276
Yes, it is.

00:14.606 --> 00:18.310
This is our reception desk and right there is our common space.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.219
I see.

00:19.573 --> 00:21.063
The sofas look very comfortable.

00:21.386 --> 00:21.953
They are.

00:22.258 --> 00:24.611
And here is our CEO's office.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.347
There is also a shelf here with some books we can borrow.

00:28.799 --> 00:29.863
That's lovely.

00:30.103 --> 00:31.578
And that is our meeting room.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.281
We also have our meals there sometimes.

00:34.779 --> 00:35.405
I see.

00:35.748 --> 00:37.468
The office sure does feel comfortable.

00:37.604 --> 00:38.126
I like it.

00:38.553 --> 00:39.179
Thanks!
