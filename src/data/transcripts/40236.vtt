00:00.185 --> 00:01.731
What does make me feel more confident,...

00:01.852 --> 00:04.103
...however, is being honest with myself,...

00:04.363 --> 00:09.229
...you know, looking at the whole picture and taking inventory,...

00:09.321 --> 00:14.477
...so essentially evaluating both my weaknesses and my strengths.

00:14.543 --> 00:17.157
Like, if I'm not great at chess,...

00:17.447 --> 00:21.956
...I'm not going to tell myself that I'm great at chess before a game.

00:22.199 --> 00:24.831
It doesn't make sense to me personally.

00:25.047 --> 00:27.784
Instead, I will tell myself as it is.

00:27.980 --> 00:31.849
You know, I might say I've practiced, I've become better,...

00:32.284 --> 00:36.079
...I've learned some new strategies, and I'm still a bit slow,...

00:36.173 --> 00:38.157
...and the other person is really good,...

00:38.469 --> 00:40.305
...but there's a good chance that I can win this...

00:41.490 --> 00:42.936
...whatever the situation might be.
