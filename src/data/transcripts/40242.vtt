00:00.510 --> 00:03.486
I was quite taken by these numbers, actually.

00:03.735 --> 00:06.278
When you think about the what, thousands and thousands,...

00:06.367 --> 00:08.869
…seven thousand edible plants worldwide,...

00:09.221 --> 00:11.715
…and we only eat just over 400 of them.

00:12.001 --> 00:12.985
Why is that?

00:13.069 --> 00:15.463
Why aren't we growing and exploring more options?

00:16.681 --> 00:19.701
I think it just happened by chance alone.

00:19.790 --> 00:25.037
Actually, our ancestors about 10,000 years ago, selected a handful of plants,...

00:25.141 --> 00:28.066
...to domesticate because they were appealing.

00:28.152 --> 00:30.011
They provided a very good source of food.

00:30.267 --> 00:33.131
They, over time, provided good yields.

00:33.249 --> 00:35.849
And they were very good at feeding the world.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.336
And that's why they were spread around.

00:37.678 --> 00:40.979
And these plants are maize, rice and wheat.

00:41.378 --> 00:43.977
And there's still great crops to grow and eat.

00:44.075 --> 00:47.006
The problem is that if one of them fails,...

00:47.364 --> 00:49.581
…if one of them is not resilient to climate change,...

00:49.668 --> 00:52.359
…then, we're going to be in trouble because we rely on them so heavily.

00:52.696 --> 00:56.625
And so, what we propose is to diversify our food systems,...

00:56.709 --> 01:00.857
...to rely on the very broad diversity of edible plants that's out there.

01:01.505 --> 01:04.792
But, how easy will it be to actually scale up,...

01:04.877 --> 01:07.529
…the production of some of these foods?

01:08.266 --> 01:10.259
I think it's very dependent.

01:10.327 --> 01:13.522
So, there are about 7,000 edible plants out there,...

01:13.598 --> 01:19.484
…and 400 of those are already crops, either minor or major crops.

01:19.570 --> 01:22.302
And so, it's very plant specific,...

01:22.381 --> 01:23.846
…whether they're going to be scaled up or not.

01:23.937 --> 01:28.033
…and something that we have to keep in mind at the forefront,...

01:28.128 --> 01:32.685
...is to make sure that the populations that already rely on these plants,...

01:32.769 --> 01:36.081
…are still able to access these plants.
