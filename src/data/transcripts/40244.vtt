00:00.171 --> 00:01.977
My office is in an old building.

00:02.618 --> 00:03.757
It's near the market.

00:04.235 --> 00:06.120
There are three rooms on our floor.

00:06.635 --> 00:09.351
In the first room, there are many workstations.

00:10.016 --> 00:12.815
In the second room, there is a big meeting space.

00:13.376 --> 00:16.658
There are fifty chairs and a small stage inside the room.

00:18.169 --> 00:20.050
My favorite room is the dining hall.

00:20.464 --> 00:21.825
We take our break there.

00:23.761 --> 00:25.547
My office is in a busy street.

00:26.021 --> 00:29.973
It can be noisy sometimes, but my co-workers and I love the place.

00:30.753 --> 00:33.895
My favorite room in the office is the open working space.

00:34.255 --> 00:37.190
There are long tables and big computers in the room.

00:37.731 --> 00:40.829
There is a couch where we can sit when we want to take a break.

00:41.221 --> 00:43.786
I also like the plants around the working space.

00:44.228 --> 00:45.309
They are good to see.
