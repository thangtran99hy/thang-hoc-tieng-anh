00:00.050 --> 00:02.223
And Eric, do we have clarity tonight,...

00:02.307 --> 00:08.727
…on exactly how monkeypox is being spread and apparently so quickly?

00:10.843 --> 00:14.973
Yeah, you know, there is discussion that it's sexually transmitted,...

00:15.069 --> 00:18.087
…but obviously traditionally with monkeypox,...

00:18.427 --> 00:22.743
…you also can have direct contact with scabs, with bodily fluids,...

00:23.107 --> 00:24.318
…it's well known.

00:24.410 --> 00:28.277
And CDC has acknowledged, as theoretically possible,...

00:28.582 --> 00:30.939
…that it is aerosol, airborne.

00:31.263 --> 00:34.303
And therefore, they recommend you take precautions,...

00:34.372 --> 00:38.243
…against aerosol transmission until we learn more.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.491
Because we have to have the humility,...

00:41.583 --> 00:44.424
...to know that, you know, many, two years ago,...

00:44.510 --> 00:47.140
…we said, "Oh, it's just the flu" for COVID.

00:47.219 --> 00:48.394
"Oh, it wasn't airborne."

00:48.585 --> 00:50.260
But did turn out to be airborne.

00:50.516 --> 00:53.319
It did turn out to have lots of reinfection potential,...

00:53.399 --> 00:54.510
…and it wasn't just the flu.

00:54.857 --> 00:57.595
So, with especially new virus, potentially,...

00:57.673 --> 01:00.545
…a new version of this virus, potentially with 50 mutations,...

01:00.925 --> 01:03.580
...we have to be extra precautious until we learn more.

01:04.015 --> 01:05.673
And in some countries,...

01:05.751 --> 01:08.069
…and I'm talking about right here in Germany as well,...

01:08.403 --> 01:11.389
…there are no recommendations right now,...

01:12.033 --> 01:16.173
...in terms of what people should do regarding monkeypox.

01:16.254 --> 01:18.867
What would your recommendation be tonight?

01:20.777 --> 01:24.309
Well, I think, first of all, be very careful about any close contact,...

01:24.389 --> 01:25.771
...so, definitely wash your hands.

01:26.031 --> 01:26.857
And you know what?

01:27.021 --> 01:29.096
Masking may have a double benefit,...

01:29.195 --> 01:32.833
…against both COVID and potentially monkeypox,...

01:32.933 --> 01:35.528
…if this theoretically airborne is true.

01:35.858 --> 01:39.771
It's supported by experimental evidence as well.

01:40.119 --> 01:43.257
So, we should really take the same precautions as COVID.
