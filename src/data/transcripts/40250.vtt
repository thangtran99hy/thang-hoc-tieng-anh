00:00.082 --> 00:02.817
Right on the heels of releasing their new anthology album "Proof,"...

00:02.904 --> 00:05.761
...the men of BTS have announced an indefinite hiatus.

00:05.912 --> 00:08.089
The revelation came during an hour-long Festa dinner...

00:08.205 --> 00:09.659
...in which the members sat around a table,...

00:09.745 --> 00:11.603
...joking around while deciding what to drink,...

00:11.763 --> 00:13.514
...reminiscing about their rocket ride to fame...

00:13.665 --> 00:14.986
...and playfully teasing each other.

00:15.268 --> 00:18.549
RM elaborated that after singles like "Dynamite" and "Permission to Dance,"...

00:18.645 --> 00:21.429
...he lost the message he wanted to tell the world through BTS,...

00:21.584 --> 00:25.171
...but J-Hope left us with all the hope for a new chapter with BTS.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.605
He's the first soloist to break out during the hiatus.

00:27.699 --> 00:30.475
He's performing at American festival Lollapalooza next month.
