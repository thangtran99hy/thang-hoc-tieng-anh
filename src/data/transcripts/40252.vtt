00:01.188 --> 00:01.785
In our story,...

00:01.863 --> 00:05.931
...we find Maverick pushing the envelope of human performance and aviation.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.079
Control, this is Darkstar, how do you read?

00:08.365 --> 00:09.753
Darkstar, control, loud and clear.

00:10.493 --> 00:13.911
Working in partnership with Lockheed Martin and Skunk Works,...

00:14.070 --> 00:18.974
...we were able to create Darkstar, our full-scale prototype for the film.

00:19.097 --> 00:20.286
One last ride.

00:21.582 --> 00:25.290
We based the design on the fastest aircraft,...

00:25.498 --> 00:28.761
...the SR-71, which Lockheed built in the 1960s.

00:28.891 --> 00:30.574
The team wanted to go beyond that.

00:32.111 --> 00:37.076
We integrated their Skunk Works designers with our designers on the film side.

00:37.622 --> 00:38.929
We lowered it a little bit.

00:39.096 --> 00:41.175
It also made it look a little bit sleeker and faster.

00:42.724 --> 00:44.273
The cockpit was mind-blowing,...

00:44.529 --> 00:46.930
...like the intel of where everything would be for a pilot.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.387
You really wanted to believe that it was real.

00:50.101 --> 00:50.873
Through their design team,...

00:50.960 --> 00:55.461
...we learned how to make the plane look angry, mean, insanely fast.

00:56.661 --> 00:59.679
It felt like something that could truly fly.

01:01.416 --> 01:04.855
The partnership with Lockheed Martin was invaluable.

01:04.985 --> 01:09.611
There's no way we could have done Darkstar the way we did without their help.

01:09.841 --> 01:12.299
We wanted that moment in the Darkstar flight.

01:12.383 --> 01:12.976
Come on.

01:13.183 --> 01:19.447
We just feel not only the command to fly, but the beauty of flight.

01:19.666 --> 01:21.287
He's the fastest man alive.
