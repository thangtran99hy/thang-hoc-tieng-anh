00:00.854 --> 00:03.009
Toyota has pushed back against critics...

00:03.101 --> 00:06.333
...who say it's not driving quick enough towards electrification.

00:06.725 --> 00:09.657
The Japanese carmaker argued it needed to offer choices...

00:09.730 --> 00:11.989
...to suit different markets and customers.

00:12.553 --> 00:15.976
The world's largest automaker said it would stick with technologies...

00:16.076 --> 00:18.406
...like fuel cell vehicles and hybrids.

00:18.836 --> 00:22.179
Toyota has long argued that hybrids will make sense in markets...

00:22.260 --> 00:24.618
...where the infrastructure isn't ready for a faster move...

00:24.689 --> 00:26.491
...towards battery electric vehicles.

00:27.229 --> 00:29.517
The firm was once a favorite of environmentalists...

00:29.597 --> 00:32.241
...thanks to the popularity of its hybrid Prius model.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.854
But some investors have now attacked Toyota...

00:35.152 --> 00:39.271
...for not phasing out gasoline-powered cars and being slow to go electric.

00:39.902 --> 00:44.155
Not until last month did it roll out its first mass-produced, all-electric vehicle.

00:44.706 --> 00:48.313
Last year, the company committed to spend 60 billion dollars by 2030...

00:48.381 --> 00:52.635
...to electrify its cars, half of which will go on fully electric vehicles.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.487
Toyota also faced questions on its CEO's succession plan...

00:56.665 --> 00:58.566
...and on the ongoing chip shortage.

00:59.067 --> 01:04.001
There was no sign the CEO Akio Toyoda plans to step down after many years in charge.

01:04.722 --> 01:08.026
The company also said it expected the chip shortage to continue,...

01:08.381 --> 01:10.545
...although it believed there were signs of improvement.
