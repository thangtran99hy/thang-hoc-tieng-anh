00:00.397 --> 00:04.279
The ominous song that struck fear into the hearts of millions around the world...

00:06.320 --> 00:08.113
...means Squid Game is back,...

00:08.449 --> 00:11.031
...the most popular series ever on Netflix.

00:13.076 --> 00:14.257
This time for real.

00:14.746 --> 00:15.336
Sort of.

00:15.953 --> 00:17.531
A newly announced reality show...

00:17.620 --> 00:22.543
...with 456 competitors and 4.56 million dollars at stake for the winner.

00:23.040 --> 00:23.912
Sound familiar?

00:25.575 --> 00:28.574
Squid Game: The Challenge comes amid struggles at Netflix.

00:29.006 --> 00:32.235
Its stock price is down more than 70% so far this year...

00:32.573 --> 00:35.266
...after the company announced a steep loss in subscribers.

00:35.554 --> 00:37.861
They are looking to bring subscribers back.

00:38.031 --> 00:41.724
What better way to do that than bring back the Squid Game audience?

00:42.029 --> 00:44.609
They've also seen success in other reality shows,...

00:44.677 --> 00:47.824
...so it's a great way to combine one audience with another...

00:47.909 --> 00:51.049
...and hopefully bring in a whole new group of subscribers.

00:51.331 --> 00:53.916
Perhaps an attempt to capitalize on the massive success...

00:53.991 --> 00:58.027
...of the ultraviolent Korean-language thriller that swept the globe last fall.
