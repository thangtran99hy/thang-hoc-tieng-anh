Vivian Springford's career has long defied any category of art.

00:05.181 --> 00:11.013
A 1932 debutante, Springford skirted expectations and instead went to art school.

00:11.748 --> 00:15.177
For over a decade, she would work as a figurative painter and teacher...

00:15.550 --> 00:18.348
...before making the turn to abstract expressionism.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.907
Springford's inspiration came from what was around her...

00:26.580 --> 00:29.219
...and ranged from Asian art and Taoist calligraphy...

00:29.577 --> 00:32.375
...to perhaps most recognizably nature.

00:37.522 --> 00:40.413
Her layered and vibrant pools of saturated color...

00:40.755 --> 00:43.491
...are both a result of intention and chance.

00:44.192 --> 00:48.879
She'd drip paint over the canvas, then tilt and tip it to create bursts of color.

00:51.424 --> 00:54.655
In one of her final bodies of work, known as the Scuba series,...

00:54.949 --> 00:58.676
...we see an artist fully harnessing the emotive power of color.

01:03.393 --> 01:06.284
Expressive, meditative and moving,...

01:06.849 --> 01:10.853
...Vivian Springford's intricately, delicate work brings a fresh perspective...

01:11.144 --> 01:12.581
...to the world of abstraction.
