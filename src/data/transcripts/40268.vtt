00:00.050 --> 00:02.263
Every Porsche has the soul of a sports car,...

00:02.476 --> 00:04.244
...but everyone talks about this one;...

00:05.575 --> 00:08.460
...does its best work here, here and over there.

00:08.889 --> 00:09.648
The 911.

00:10.317 --> 00:12.265
Perfected since 1963.

00:12.992 --> 00:14.817
Engine in the back, driver up front.

00:15.108 --> 00:17.740
Launches like one of these, turns like one of these.

00:18.361 --> 00:21.176
That profile, find me a more timeless shape.

00:21.382 --> 00:22.809
Go look, I'll wait.

00:24.003 --> 00:25.931
The 911 is the spirit of Porsche.

00:26.011 --> 00:27.307
More than a million made.

00:27.659 --> 00:29.841
Rear wheel drive, all-wheel drive, take your pick.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.709
Two seats, four seats, wings, scoops and flex, you name it.

00:33.142 --> 00:34.156
And then there's this.

00:34.961 --> 00:37.782
The 718 Cayman and Boxster, roof or no roof.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.591
Trunk in the front, engine in the middle...

00:39.930 --> 00:41.497
...and actually, another trunk in the back.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.042
Like those tail lights?

00:43.535 --> 00:45.583
Memorize them because that's all you'll see.

00:46.293 --> 00:49.853
Like their big brother, they're lightweight and fun and inspired by racing.

00:50.139 --> 00:52.677
Does that make them perfect? I think so.
