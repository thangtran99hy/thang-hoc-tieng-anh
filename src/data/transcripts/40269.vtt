00:00.383 --> 00:01.149
Excuse me.

00:01.532 --> 00:02.569
Hi, can I help you?

00:02.901 --> 00:05.243
Yeah, I need to buy some bus tickets.

00:05.605 --> 00:06.657
How many do you need?

00:07.003 --> 00:09.939
I'm not sure, but I need enough for an entire month.

00:10.537 --> 00:12.562
You should buy a pass; it's much cheaper.

00:12.895 --> 00:15.274
How many times can I ride the bus with a pass?

00:15.631 --> 00:17.163
As many times as you want.

00:17.599 --> 00:19.488
You just need to buy a pass each month.

00:19.788 --> 00:21.405
That sounds like a better option.

00:22.111 --> 00:23.325
Do you have a business card?

00:23.692 --> 00:25.462
They give a discount for office workers.

00:25.741 --> 00:26.453
Oh, wow.

00:26.650 --> 00:27.429
Yes, I have.

00:28.317 --> 00:29.160
Let me see.

00:29.533 --> 00:31.964
You should go to the ticket booth and show them your card.

00:32.646 --> 00:33.746
They will give you a discount.

00:34.102 --> 00:34.735
That's great.

00:35.099 --> 00:35.558
Thank you.

00:35.897 --> 00:36.543
You're welcome.
