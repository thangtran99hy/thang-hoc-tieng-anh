00:01.373 --> 00:01.762
Ketchup.

00:02.032 --> 00:05.965
So American, it's basically the red in red, white and blue, right?

00:06.474 --> 00:09.984
And that red clearly is from the tomatoes the ketchup is made from.

00:11.811 --> 00:13.843
But that wasn't always the case.

00:14.170 --> 00:17.516
The first recorded recipe for ketchup comes from China,...

00:17.907 --> 00:22.279
...and for more than 1,000 years, it wasn't even made with tomatoes.

00:22.869 --> 00:24.597
It was made with fish guts.

00:27.506 --> 00:31.323
Fish intestines, bladder and stomach, all mixed together with salt,...

00:31.779 --> 00:35.476
...then sealed and heated in the hot summer sun for 20 days.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.779
That was the original ketchup,...

00:38.200 --> 00:41.917
...a fermented fishpaste that dates back to 6th century China.

00:42.464 --> 00:46.107
It was popular throughout Southeast Asia, and British and Dutch settlers...

00:46.180 --> 00:48.894
...who arrived in the 1600s loved the stuff.

00:49.152 --> 00:53.082
Over time, they brought ketchup home to Europe and added their own modifications,...

00:53.556 --> 00:58.371
...including beer, mushrooms, walnuts, oysters, strawberries and peaches.

00:59.954 --> 01:04.177
By the mid 1700s, English ketchup was a mainstay on British dinner tables...

01:04.310 --> 01:08.275
...and as colonists went west, it soon made its way across the pond.

01:08.615 --> 01:10.409
That's where tomatoes come in.

01:10.647 --> 01:12.226
They're native to the Americas...

01:12.407 --> 01:15.661
...and it's rumored Europeans once believed they were poisonous.

01:15.864 --> 01:17.741
But poisonous they were not.

01:20.126 --> 01:23.575
In 1812, a Philadelphia horticulturalist and scientist...

01:23.665 --> 01:27.078
...by the name of James Meese introduced tomatoes into the mix.

01:27.384 --> 01:29.512
He published a tomato ketchup recipe...

01:29.750 --> 01:32.393
...that was the beginning of a new crimson era.

01:33.066 --> 01:35.927
From there, many different iterations were concocted...

01:36.171 --> 01:38.053
...and by the end of the 18th century,...

01:38.149 --> 01:40.217
...the New York Tribune called tomato ketchup...

01:40.528 --> 01:44.649
...America's national condiment that was on every table in the land.

01:45.102 --> 01:46.989
Which brings us back to this.

01:47.401 --> 01:49.203
Tomato ketchup is here to stay.

01:49.473 --> 01:52.116
And I, for one, don't miss the fish guts.
