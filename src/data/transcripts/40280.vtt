00:00.149 --> 00:02.556
The end of an era today in New York.

00:02.655 --> 00:06.135
One of the last of the public phones was taken away,...

00:06.215 --> 00:08.325
…while some private phones will still be around.

00:08.401 --> 00:10.205
CBS Dick Brennan shows us the ones,...

00:10.287 --> 00:12.967
…you see on the streets will largely be gone.

00:13.977 --> 00:16.226
It's last call for public payphones.

00:16.444 --> 00:20.718
At 49th and 7th, a few of these technological dinosaurs were hauled away,...

00:21.018 --> 00:23.913
…while fittingly stared down by a T-Rex on a billboard.

00:24.278 --> 00:26.947
But it's not quite the end of the line for these landlines.

00:27.209 --> 00:28.583
Some would be sticking around.

00:28.871 --> 00:29.781
Do you know what that is?

00:30.333 --> 00:30.758
No.

00:30.913 --> 00:31.346
No?

00:31.510 --> 00:34.618
Try explaining a pay phone to someone born 6 years ago.

00:35.143 --> 00:36.835
It's like an old-fashioned cellphone.

00:36.931 --> 00:37.983
Yeah, it's like a phone.

00:38.117 --> 00:38.799
I mean, this is a phone.

00:38.882 --> 00:40.237
It's a phone, sometimes.

00:40.514 --> 00:42.445
You will still find private pay phones,...

00:42.531 --> 00:45.144
…and these four phone booths which will be preserved,...

00:45.226 --> 00:48.696
…on West End Avenue between 66th and 101st streets.

00:49.063 --> 00:51.136
But, even if some locals who remember when,...

00:51.447 --> 00:53.100
…want no part of them, now.

00:53.715 --> 00:55.669
When was the last time you used that pay phone?

00:55.998 --> 00:59.139
That pay phone? Never. Zero!

00:59.287 --> 01:03.117
Before the cellphone era, you could find a pay phone practically on every block.

01:03.193 --> 01:07.039
It's a relic of an era that was so common around here.

01:07.144 --> 01:09.199
But eventually, they didn't even work for Superman.

01:11.757 --> 01:15.011
Still, some can't resist the draw of the old-fashioned, folding,...

01:15.083 --> 01:16.551
...so-called the Superman booth.

01:16.628 --> 01:17.566
So, I love this.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.840
Come on. How much do I want?

01:22.913 --> 01:23.605
You want everything?
