A spokesperson for Google said that,...

00:02.064 --> 00:06.009
…while chatbots can imitate conversation, they are not free thinking,...

00:06.430 --> 00:09.393
…but, what made the company's former employees speak out?

00:09.506 --> 00:11.545
Well, let's bring you some insights into that.

00:11.629 --> 00:16.337
I'm joined by our technology editor, Zoey Kleinman, who is with us here today.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.415
Zoey, what is all this about?

00:18.730 --> 00:20.193
It's a fascinating story, isn't it?

00:20.283 --> 00:24.566
So, Google created an artificial intelligence project which it called LaMDA,...

00:24.637 --> 00:26.524
…and it was designed to generate chatbots.

00:26.823 --> 00:28.629
Chatbots are the things you see when you go online,...

00:28.720 --> 00:29.869
…you know, a little box pops up.

00:29.978 --> 00:30.705
"Can I help you?"

00:31.011 --> 00:32.221
"Can I", you know, "book your flight?"

00:32.310 --> 00:33.735
"Can I advise you?"

00:34.000 --> 00:34.621
That sort of thing.

00:34.695 --> 00:37.316
Google wanted to make them as realistic as possible.

00:37.385 --> 00:40.185
It's spent about five years now creating this.

00:41.245 --> 00:45.427
The senior engineer says he had a chat with it, a conversation.

00:45.497 --> 00:46.526
He kind of interviewed it.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.107
He's published a really long blog...

00:48.196 --> 00:51.334
…but it's a very interesting read in which he asked it a series of questions,...

00:51.783 --> 00:55.326
…and the responses that it gave were fascinating on a range of subjects.

00:55.419 --> 00:56.093
And he asked it things like,...

00:56.169 --> 00:58.195
…"do you like the story of Les Misérables?"

00:58.265 --> 01:01.623
…and this chatbot talked about feeling sorry for one of the characters.

01:01.739 --> 01:04.945
It talks about being afraid of death, being afraid of being switched off.

01:05.052 --> 01:08.837
It talks about understanding feelings of happiness and sadness.

01:09.430 --> 01:12.041
And it's just not what you would expect, is it, from...

01:13.028 --> 01:16.392
…something that is, that has been created, to generate speech.
