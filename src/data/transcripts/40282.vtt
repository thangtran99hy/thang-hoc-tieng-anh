The city of Amarillo, Texas, is asking folks to guess, what is this thing?

00:07.069 --> 00:11.387
The image was captured last month at 1:25 AM,...

00:11.485 --> 00:14.933
...by a camera set up inside the Amarillo Zoo,...

00:15.499 --> 00:17.683
...looking out through a perimeter fence.

00:17.966 --> 00:21.273
Is it a person with a strange hat who likes to walk at night?

00:21.374 --> 00:26.343
City officials asked in a tweet, referring to it as a UAO.

00:26.519 --> 00:28.868
The Unidentified Amarillo object.

00:29.048 --> 00:29.487
Wow.

00:29.957 --> 00:34.462
Let the guesses begin, from Fantastic Mr. Fox.

00:34.569 --> 00:36.819
"I don't wanna live in a hole anymore."

00:37.165 --> 00:40.551
To Rocket Raccoon from "Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:41.379 --> 00:43.991
Oh yeah.

00:44.137 --> 00:46.292
The camera is motion-activated,...

00:46.392 --> 00:49.855
...and sends an alert to zoo officials when it captures something.

00:50.099 --> 00:52.270
There were some serious theories.

00:52.599 --> 00:54.624
The raccoon standing on its hind legs,...

00:54.718 --> 00:57.383
...or potentially a person walking through the park,...

00:57.505 --> 01:01.138
...that just happened to get captured in a peculiar way.

01:02.375 --> 01:05.137
But the public's guesses were more colorful,...

01:05.281 --> 01:10.414
...from Sonic the Hedgehog to the San Antonio Spurs coyote mascot.

01:12.649 --> 01:14.339
Someone tweeted the movie,...

01:14.446 --> 01:18.359
..."Dog Soldiers called and want their werewolf back."

01:21.262 --> 01:24.487
Another poster wondered, "Is this guy on the loose?"

01:24.689 --> 01:27.355
And, of course, there were references to Bigfoot.

01:27.731 --> 01:31.209
Someone thought Littlefoot might be more appropriate.

01:31.854 --> 01:34.625
There is no video, just this image.

01:34.763 --> 01:37.725
One poster went all out to illustrate his theory,...

01:37.807 --> 01:39.993
...it was a "coyote jumping the fence,"...

01:40.466 --> 01:44.261
...diagrammed with anatomy like ears, tail, et cetera.

01:44.377 --> 01:44.967
Noted.

01:45.473 --> 01:49.939
If nothing else, all these guesses could leave folks howling.

01:52.114 --> 01:55.149
