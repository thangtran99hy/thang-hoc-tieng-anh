00:00.099 --> 00:01.686
We the People...

00:02.613 --> 00:05.233
We the People tell the government what to do.

00:05.687 --> 00:06.963
It doesn't tell us.

00:07.531 --> 00:09.051
We the People are the driver.

00:09.475 --> 00:10.652
The Government is the car...

00:11.243 --> 00:15.286
...and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast.

00:16.025 --> 00:19.772
Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments...

00:20.299 --> 00:22.462
...tell the people what their privileges are.

00:23.477 --> 00:28.477
Our constitution is a document in which we the people tell the government...

00:29.015 --> 00:30.536
...what it is allowed to do.

00:31.477 --> 00:33.453
We the People are free.
