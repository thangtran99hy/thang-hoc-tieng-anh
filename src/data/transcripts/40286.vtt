00:01.207 --> 00:03.473
Oda's world is so unique.

00:03.663 --> 00:05.467
Seeing all of this stuff in person,...

00:05.573 --> 00:11.312
...being able to reach out and touch it, has just been such an experience.

00:11.406 --> 00:15.159
Our crews down here in South Africa are incredible,...

00:15.519 --> 00:23.054
...and it's been so rewarding to see them taking Oda's world and bringing it to life.

00:24.392 --> 00:28.304
Because of the level of detail and attention that goes into all of these sets,...

00:28.429 --> 00:30.763
...they take a good amount of time.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.758
And right now, we're building Arlong's map room,...

00:33.971 --> 00:35.484
...and it's already been a couple of weeks,...

00:35.558 --> 00:38.611
...but it's a big build because it's a really important location.

00:38.723 --> 00:40.179
A lot of drama goes down in there.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.267
A lot of action goes down in there.

00:42.595 --> 00:43.875
So we have to get it just right.
