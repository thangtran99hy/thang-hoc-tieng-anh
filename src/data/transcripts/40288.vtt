00:06.409 --> 00:08.541
Curiosity is what drives me.

00:10.180 --> 00:13.828
The ultimate thrill to me is diving down to the bottom...

00:13.937 --> 00:16.721
...and finding that fish that nobody has ever seen before.

00:17.274 --> 00:20.661
The key for succeeding is persisting and never giving up.

00:22.459 --> 00:25.932
In life, one should have passion and a feeling of adventure,...

00:26.845 --> 00:29.132
...and that is what my work offers me every day.

00:29.514 --> 00:31.985
I'm really passionate about the mountain environment...

00:32.159 --> 00:33.808
...and the community where I'm living.

00:34.173 --> 00:35.522
I think that is what matters.

00:39.385 --> 00:43.763
I really love my work, and this is why I'm always looking for the next project.

00:45.031 --> 00:48.854
The world's most northerly caves haven't yet been explored.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.181
For me, it's about being limitless.

00:51.333 --> 00:54.225
If there's a horizon, try and see past that horizon.

00:57.653 --> 01:00.451
I get my energy from my people.

01:01.549 --> 01:04.379
They are the ones who are making humanity grow...

01:04.943 --> 01:10.187
...because they are the ones who are protecting us from all the climate impact.

01:13.512 --> 01:16.080
I have the opportunity to do something.

01:16.559 --> 01:18.636
I want to do my part in making a change,...

01:18.805 --> 01:21.261
...providing that basic human right: good nutrition.

01:21.530 --> 01:26.062
That means perseverance, that means integrity and doing it day after day.
