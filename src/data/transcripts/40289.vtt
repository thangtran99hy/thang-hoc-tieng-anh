00:00.246 --> 00:02.920
I was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:03.089 --> 00:06.451
There were a lot of issues with infrastructure in the country.

00:06.667 --> 00:11.593
I had always imagined me coming to the U.S. for college to major in civil engineering.

00:11.770 --> 00:16.119
My name is Samuel Makisikala, and I'm graduating from Pasadena City College.

00:16.571 --> 00:20.887
When I arrived, I was excited to meet new people and make new friends.

00:21.339 --> 00:23.889
But then COVID hit.

00:24.591 --> 00:25.945
Everything was online.

00:26.491 --> 00:28.263
I didn't know anybody here.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.409
I was lonely and homesick.

00:30.721 --> 00:32.181
I felt like giving up.

00:32.415 --> 00:35.988
But my sister told me, you gotta be the change you want to see.

00:36.368 --> 00:38.593
I was waking up at 3:00 AM to go to work.

00:38.801 --> 00:41.603
Then I would come home to take my online classes.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.892
It was physically and mentally exhausting.

00:45.448 --> 00:46.975
But now, I'm here.

00:47.551 --> 00:50.355
I could not have done it without my sister's support.

00:50.782 --> 00:53.383
I am proud to celebrate this milestone,...

00:53.518 --> 00:56.997
...and I'm continuing to pursue my purpose to make a difference.
