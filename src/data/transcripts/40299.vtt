00:02.046 --> 00:04.870
Every family needs an emergency evacuation plan.

00:05.189 --> 00:09.304
You should know where to meet, how you'll get there and plan for an alternate route.

00:09.739 --> 00:11.783
A proper evacuation plan can help get you...

00:11.969 --> 00:14.671
...and your family to safety and avoid getting stranded.

00:15.161 --> 00:17.495
Should a catastrophe separate you and your family,...

00:17.904 --> 00:21.336
...it's very important to designate a contact outside of your area.

00:21.737 --> 00:24.621
Your contact can be your connection to friends and family,...

00:24.809 --> 00:27.458
...even if there's no way to contact each other directly.
