00:01.880 --> 00:04.431
The future isn't something you wait for.

00:09.850 --> 00:11.199
It's something you make.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.998
If you hear the music, make that music.

00:21.835 --> 00:24.128
If you want to dance, dance.

00:27.587 --> 00:30.737
Plenty of voices out there telling you what not to do,...

00:32.309 --> 00:35.269
...but there is one voice pointing you forward.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.464
Listen to that voice.

00:40.039 --> 00:43.131
Hold on to it and make your future.
