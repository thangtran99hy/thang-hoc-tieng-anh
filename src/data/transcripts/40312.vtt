00:01.333 --> 00:02.779
Why is the world warming up?

00:04.989 --> 00:08.293
Let's think of Earth for just a moment as a greenhouse.

00:09.527 --> 00:11.876
Every second, a huge amount of energy...

00:11.959 --> 00:13.383
...smashes into our greenhouse.

00:15.424 --> 00:20.680
Our atmosphere, the glass roof and walls, reflect some of that energy,...

00:21.164 --> 00:24.115
...but most of it passes right through and heats everything up.

00:25.976 --> 00:28.452
Much of that heat used to escape back into space,...

00:28.547 --> 00:30.645
...keeping us at a stable, warm temperature.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.465
But then something changed.

00:34.517 --> 00:37.195
Humans began to spew enough carbon dioxide...

00:37.269 --> 00:39.537
...to fill billions of greenhouses each day.

00:44.138 --> 00:46.270
It makes the glass of our greenhouse thicker.

00:47.412 --> 00:50.623
Thicker glass means heat escapes into space much more slowly.

00:51.062 --> 00:53.865
And don't forget, energy from the sun is still streaming in...

00:54.010 --> 00:55.326
...just as quickly as before.

00:55.887 --> 00:59.565
The result is a planet with temperatures too hot for our liking...

00:59.682 --> 01:02.861
...and and eventually living.
