00:00.050 --> 00:02.423
From the beginning, Juul products were a hit.

00:02.498 --> 00:06.043
It was easy to use, came in different colors and flavors, and at one time,...

00:06.115 --> 00:11.513
...it had 75 percent market share, but now, its future is in doubt.

00:11.631 --> 00:16.007
Bad news for Altria, the cigarette company that owns a 35 percent stake,...

00:16.603 --> 00:19.142
â€¦but good news perhaps for firms like R. J. Reynolds,...

00:19.219 --> 00:23.627
...whose vuse e-cigarettes already have approval to remain on the market.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.834
So, what exactly happened?

00:26.023 --> 00:27.805
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration...

00:27.883 --> 00:31.138
...has ordered Juul to stop selling its e-cigarette device...

00:31.241 --> 00:34.999
...and four types of Juul pods in America, its biggest market,...

00:35.524 --> 00:39.715
...pointing to its role in fueling an epidemic of teenage vaping.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.670
The decision comes nearly two years...

00:42.746 --> 00:45.987
...after the company submitted its application to the FDA...

00:46.067 --> 00:48.308
...with the hopes of continuing to sell their products.

00:48.768 --> 00:50.211
However, the agency concluded...

00:50.305 --> 00:53.636
...that Juul had failed to prove their products met legal standards,...

00:53.741 --> 00:56.757
...saying they had provided insufficient and conflicting data,...

00:57.265 --> 01:01.395
...especially about potential harmful chemicals leaching from Juul pods.
