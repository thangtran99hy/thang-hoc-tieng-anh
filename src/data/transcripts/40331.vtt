If you're anything like me,...

00:01.957 --> 00:05.729
...then you probably find yourself dealing with this problem on a fairly regular basis.

00:05.823 --> 00:07.278
You should be going to bed,...

00:07.385 --> 00:10.760
...but there's just so many more interesting things to do at night.

00:11.067 --> 00:12.861
So what can we do about this problem?

00:13.117 --> 00:16.441
Well, one simple solution is to create a night routine.

00:16.611 --> 00:20.985
A night routine is just like a morning routine, but in reverse.

00:21.233 --> 00:23.494
Instead of helping you wake up and get ready for the day,...

00:23.607 --> 00:25.492
...it helps you to smoothly end your day...

00:25.585 --> 00:28.847
...and also make sure that you get to bed in time to get enough sleep.

00:29.423 --> 00:32.735
But there is another benefit to having a good night routine.

00:33.189 --> 00:35.234
In addition to helping you wind down today,...

00:35.655 --> 00:38.263
...it also helps you prepare for the next day as well.

00:38.351 --> 00:41.509
Today, we are constructing a one-hour nighttime routine.

00:41.601 --> 00:44.459
And with this routine, we've got three different goals in mind.

00:44.601 --> 00:48.618
Number one, wind down the day so you feel relaxed when it's time to go to bed.

00:48.820 --> 00:52.728
Number two, actually get yourself in bed on time so you're getting enough sleep.

00:52.921 --> 00:57.162
And number three, do a few things to help you prepare for the next day.
