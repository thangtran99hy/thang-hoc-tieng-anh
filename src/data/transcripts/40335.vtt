Hey, Tom.

00:00.769 --> 00:02.111
Can I borrow your pen, please?

00:02.357 --> 00:02.636
Sure.

00:02.869 --> 00:03.370
Here you go.

00:03.595 --> 00:04.179
Thank you.

00:05.619 --> 00:08.229
Tina, could you help me find some information here?

00:08.522 --> 00:08.913
Sure.

00:09.022 --> 00:09.575
Here you go.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.275
Great.

00:10.516 --> 00:11.193
Thanks for the help.

00:12.469 --> 00:14.073
Tina, could you come here for a second?

00:14.371 --> 00:14.809
What is it?

00:15.411 --> 00:16.876
We can't open this laptop.

00:17.149 --> 00:17.948
Let me see.

00:18.293 --> 00:18.970
Oh, there.

00:19.304 --> 00:20.153
The screen is on.

00:20.413 --> 00:20.893
Thanks.

00:21.386 --> 00:21.725
All right.

00:21.851 --> 00:22.632
Anything else?

00:23.273 --> 00:23.813
No more.

00:24.033 --> 00:24.684
Thanks again.
