00:00.579 --> 00:03.111
When he became prime minister in 2012,...

00:03.244 --> 00:06.036
...Shinzo Abe was no stranger to the office.

00:06.437 --> 00:09.826
He'd already held the post for a year in 2006...

00:10.145 --> 00:14.097
...during Japan's so-called revolving door premiership period,...

00:14.436 --> 00:16.990
...when factionalism within the ruling party...

00:17.205 --> 00:19.725
...led to a rapid turnover in leaders.

00:20.155 --> 00:22.405
By 2012, that period was over,...

00:22.663 --> 00:25.859
...offering Abe the chance to rule uninterrupted.

00:27.139 --> 00:32.393
"I will increase jobs and incomes and revitalize the countryside," he promised,...

00:32.621 --> 00:36.200
...aiming to transform Japan's stagnating economy...

00:36.403 --> 00:38.655
...with his own brand of "Abenomics."

00:38.925 --> 00:42.914
Eight years on, the results are still disappointingly mixed.

00:43.223 --> 00:44.806
A staunch conservative,...

00:44.970 --> 00:49.915
...he also set about moving away from Japan's traditional pacifist role...

00:50.167 --> 00:53.293
...and become more assertive with his Asian neighbors.

00:53.559 --> 00:57.170
But it was the unseen enemy of COVID-19,...

00:57.338 --> 01:00.860
...the critics say, saw him lacking in assertiveness.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.629
2020 was meant to be the high point of his premiership,...

01:04.845 --> 01:09.440
...hosting the Tokyo Olympics, which he'd successfully won for Japan.

01:09.683 --> 01:14.044
Abe can blame a degree of bad fortune for a tarnished legacy.

01:14.331 --> 01:15.674
But when he leaves office,...

01:15.789 --> 01:18.991
...the fact that he's served longer than any other prime minister...

01:19.195 --> 01:22.573
...might be the one achievement he's most remembered for.
