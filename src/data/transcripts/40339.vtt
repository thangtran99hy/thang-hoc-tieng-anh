You have a sister in Boston, right?

00:06.307 --> 00:07.369

00:07.798 --> 00:09.667
Are your brothers here in Korea?

00:10.082 --> 00:11.026
What do they do?

00:11.452 --> 00:14.230
Both brothers are studying in the United States.

00:14.628 --> 00:15.818
You must miss them.

00:16.611 --> 00:19.187
Yes, but I'll see them soon for the holidays.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.823
Do you have any siblings?

00:21.205 --> 00:23.880
Plenty! I am one of five.

00:24.275 --> 00:27.953
Wow! That must have been nice growing up in a large family.
