00:00.146 --> 00:02.171
What would have been a cause for celebration...

00:02.411 --> 00:03.853
...became a moment of grieving.

00:12.571 --> 00:14.391
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida...

00:14.534 --> 00:16.763
...and lawmakers from the Liberal Democratic Party...

00:16.898 --> 00:19.877
...paying homage to the assassinated Shinzo Abe...

00:20.602 --> 00:24.213
...before announcing the projected winners of the upper house elections.

00:26.637 --> 00:30.796
Exit polls show Kishida's LDP now with a stronger hold on power...

00:31.180 --> 00:35.001
...and a mandate to boost military spending to better counter China,...

00:35.281 --> 00:36.925
...a key campaign promise.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.691
Beyond that, a convincing result could also allow the government...

00:41.757 --> 00:44.365
...to revise the country's pacifist constitution,...

00:44.946 --> 00:47.199
...one of Abe's lifelong dreams,...

00:47.867 --> 00:51.514
...a vision for a more secure Japan that resonates with voters.

00:51.859 --> 00:54.861
Opinion polls show they favor greater military strength.

00:55.575 --> 00:58.100
But inflation will also be high on the agenda.

00:58.514 --> 01:01.672
Kishida has promised to enact measures to alleviate the pain...

01:01.789 --> 01:05.011
...caused by rising food and energy prices.
