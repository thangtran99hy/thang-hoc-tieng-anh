We, as a society, are eating twice as much meat...

00:03.729 --> 00:04.813
...as we did in the 50s.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.940
So what was once the special little side treat...

00:10.166 --> 00:12.167
...now is the main, much more regular.

00:12.661 --> 00:14.477
So really, any of these angles should have been enough...

00:14.584 --> 00:16.103
...to convince me to go vegetarian.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.698
And there I was, tucking into a big, old steak.

00:22.093 --> 00:23.563
So why was I stalling?

00:24.912 --> 00:28.779
I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution.

00:29.517 --> 00:32.819
It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian.

00:34.085 --> 00:36.275
And I guess I just wasn't quite ready.

00:37.296 --> 00:39.815
Imagine your last hamburger.

00:44.539 --> 00:48.001
So my common sense, my good intentions,...

00:49.051 --> 00:51.496
...were in conflict with my taste buds...

00:51.979 --> 00:54.500
...and I'd commit to doing it later.

00:55.190 --> 00:57.737
And not surprisingly, later never came.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.050
Sound familiar?
