00:00.290 --> 00:03.579
In Isesaki, it is another blazing hot day.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.035
At 11 A.M.,...

00:05.112 --> 00:08.738
...the temperature is already somewhere north of 40 degrees Celsius.

00:09.363 --> 00:11.791
For Masaya Maruyama, his wife and brother,...

00:12.230 --> 00:15.771
...working outside in these conditions isn't just hard, it's dangerous.

00:18.355 --> 00:20.813
Masaya shows me the electric fans in his jacket...

00:20.905 --> 00:22.107
...designed to keep him cool,...

00:22.750 --> 00:24.620
...but they hardly seem up to the task.

00:26.625 --> 00:30.339
It went up to 47 degrees on the car's thermometer yesterday, he tells me.

00:31.087 --> 00:32.243
Is it dangerous? I ask.

00:34.249 --> 00:35.473
Yes, it's dangerous.

00:35.779 --> 00:37.984
We've never had temperatures like this before in June.

00:38.616 --> 00:39.991
Usually, it's raining now.

00:42.567 --> 00:46.560
A week ago, most people had never heard of the little city of Isesaki,...

00:46.831 --> 00:48.771
...100 kilometers north of Tokyo.

00:49.158 --> 00:51.279
Now, it's suddenly famous.

00:51.841 --> 00:54.559
This is now officially the hottest place in Japan.

00:54.635 --> 00:58.263
It's been above 40 degrees twice already this week,...

00:58.545 --> 00:59.681
...and according to my thermometer,...

00:59.789 --> 01:02.271
...it's well above that out here in the sunshine today.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.889
This has never happened before in June anywhere in Japan.

01:07.051 --> 01:09.023
This should be the middle of the rainy season...

01:09.468 --> 01:13.251
...and it's causing huge problems for Japan's electricity generating system.

01:13.389 --> 01:15.773
It's just barely keeping up with demand,...

01:16.039 --> 01:18.094
...and if it fails, people are going to die.

01:19.657 --> 01:23.237
These heat waves are not just a natural fluctuation in weather.

01:23.621 --> 01:27.863
Man-made climate change is making them more extreme and more dangerous.
