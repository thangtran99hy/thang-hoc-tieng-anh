00:01.187 --> 00:04.428
Remote work introduced more flexibility to people's lives.

00:04.629 --> 00:07.838
Working from home saved an average of 40 minutes daily from commuting,...

00:07.946 --> 00:10.789
…and 77% of workers say they were more productive.

00:11.077 --> 00:13.895
But the need for in-person business has remained unchanged.

00:14.191 --> 00:18.416
There was a lot of benefit and a lot of goodness that came from working from home.

00:18.525 --> 00:20.619
But there was a lot of things that were missing, too, right?

00:20.717 --> 00:22.441
People missed their colleagues.

00:22.567 --> 00:27.277
We don't have that spark of innovation from meeting someone face-to-face.

00:27.629 --> 00:31.813
The tax and accounting software giant, Intuit, is one of Clive Wilkinson's clients...

00:32.007 --> 00:34.198
…and it is going all in on the hybrid model.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.983
Employees come in between two to three days in person,...

00:37.233 --> 00:38.821
…but that amount is up to each team.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.811
On days where you might be doing a lot of individual work or heads down work,...

00:43.079 --> 00:44.944
…working from home may be the right answer.

00:45.277 --> 00:46.773
But when teams need to come together...

00:46.900 --> 00:51.394
...to collaborate, build that relationship, to innovate and move faster,...

00:51.506 --> 00:54.486
...we think those are what really will draw people back to the campuses.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.418
Wilkinson has designed two buildings for Intuit.

00:57.697 --> 01:01.829
One was completed in 2016, and the other is expected to be finished next year.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.917
I did the first building with them.

01:04.233 --> 01:07.855
A lot of, kind of, great collaboration space, town hall space,...

01:07.987 --> 01:11.177
…really, kind of a well evolved working environment.

01:11.839 --> 01:16.995
We were about to repeat that, more or less, in a new building when the pandemic hit.

01:17.349 --> 01:19.915
With the second project under construction during the pandemic,...

01:20.169 --> 01:24.713
…Wilkinson and his firm redesigned the interior to reflect Intuit's new hybrid model.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.057
The initial plans for Intuit were very workstation centric.

01:28.185 --> 01:29.280
Coming through the pandemic,...

01:29.405 --> 01:32.401
...there was an acknowledgment that people are going to be working differently.

01:32.677 --> 01:38.045
And so, the architecture needs to change, functionally, to better suit the wide variety...

01:38.143 --> 01:41.535
...of new reasons why people are actually going into the office.
