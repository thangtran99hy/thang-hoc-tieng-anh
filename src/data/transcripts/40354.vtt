America is defined by one single word: possibilities.

00:05.767 --> 00:06.880
Possibilities.

00:07.481 --> 00:11.982
I want to thank the team at NASA for once again showing that, that's who we are.

00:12.197 --> 00:16.637
And now let's take a look at the very first image from this miraculous telescope.

00:18.006 --> 00:26.300
Mr. President, if you held a grain of sand on the tip of your finger at arm's length,...

00:27.468 --> 00:32.539
...that is the part of the universe that you're seeing.

00:32.661 --> 00:35.214
Just one little speck of the universe.

00:36.087 --> 00:39.641
And what you're seeing there are galaxies.

00:42.041 --> 00:47.634
You're seeing galaxies that are shining around other galaxies...

00:47.756 --> 00:49.997
...whose light has been bent,...

00:51.637 --> 00:56.969
...and you're seeing just a small little portion of the universe.

00:57.721 --> 01:01.183
Mr. President, 100 years ago, we thought there was only one galaxy.

01:02.567 --> 01:06.042
Now, the number is unlimited.

01:07.013 --> 01:11.145
And in our galaxy, we have billions of stars or suns,...

01:12.413 --> 01:18.463
...and there are billions of galaxies with billions of stars and suns...

01:18.861 --> 01:20.496
...and we're getting our first glimpse.

01:20.618 --> 01:27.850
As you said, Mr. President, we're looking back more than 13 billion years.

01:28.081 --> 01:32.423
Light travels at 186,000 miles per second...

01:33.286 --> 01:38.417
...and that light that you are seeing on one of those little specks...

01:39.157 --> 01:43.057
...has been traveling for over 13 billion years.

01:43.233 --> 01:48.313
And by the way, we're going back further because this is just the first image.

01:48.894 --> 01:53.421
They're going back about 13.5 billion years...

01:53.900 --> 01:59.121
...and since we know the universe is 13.8 billion years old,...

01:59.709 --> 02:02.627
...we're going back almost to the beginning.
