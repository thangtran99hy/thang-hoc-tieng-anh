I want to offer my condolences to Akie Abe,...

00:04.847 --> 00:07.553
...the wife of former prime minister Shinzo Abe,...

00:08.387 --> 00:10.977
...and to the rest of his family and loved ones.

00:12.431 --> 00:16.556
Our thoughts are with you and with the people of Japan today.

00:20.291 --> 00:24.121
I knew Shinzo for many years.

00:25.546 --> 00:32.662
He was a thoughtful, compassionate, strong leader...

00:32.827 --> 00:38.624
...who understood the importance of service,...

00:39.009 --> 00:41.672
...understood the importance of building a better world,...

00:42.128 --> 00:44.180
...better opportunities for his citizens,...
