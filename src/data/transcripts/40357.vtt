00:00.466 --> 00:05.139
It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party...

00:05.699 --> 00:08.444
...that there should be a new leader of that party...

00:08.567 --> 00:10.334
...and therefore, a new prime minister.

00:11.821 --> 00:14.752
Boris Johnson is stepping down as the UK's prime minister,...

00:14.970 --> 00:18.065
...unable to overcome a string of scandals around unlawful parties...

00:18.134 --> 00:21.245
...during the pandemic and broader questions about his integrity.

00:22.115 --> 00:27.532
In less than three years, he's gone from this to this.

00:27.735 --> 00:33.655
Apologies to everybody for the misjudgments that I've made,...

00:33.956 --> 00:35.283
...that we may have made.

00:36.065 --> 00:39.931
Johnson enjoyed a steady rise from journalist to London mayor to prime minister...

00:40.316 --> 00:43.894
...despite gaffes that sometimes led to accusations of racism, sexism...

00:44.115 --> 00:45.637
...and spreading misinformation.

00:46.915 --> 00:48.823
I'm sorry for the offense that I have caused,...

00:48.958 --> 00:51.915
...but I will continue to speak as directly as I can.

00:52.359 --> 00:55.328
Johnson was once considered the golden boy of the Conservative Party.

00:56.253 --> 00:57.645
So how did he climb so high?

00:58.035 --> 00:59.765
And why did his premiership fall apart?

01:00.967 --> 01:02.051
To answer that question,...

01:02.435 --> 01:04.880
...we need to understand what sort of politician Boris Johnson is,...

01:05.405 --> 01:07.838
...which means going right back to the start.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.123
What are you not ashamed of there, Boris?

01:12.010 --> 01:14.573
Whatever there is not to be ashamed of.
