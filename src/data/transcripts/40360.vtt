00:01.620 --> 00:05.309
These scenes would have been unthinkable days ago.

00:05.856 --> 00:11.528
Sri Lanka's seat of presidential power now a sightseeing destination.

00:13.706 --> 00:16.143
Security nowhere to be seen...

00:17.100 --> 00:22.875
...as thousands push their way in to a palace taken over by protesters.

00:23.655 --> 00:27.396
The man who once lived here, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa,...

00:27.664 --> 00:31.395

00:31.697 --> 00:33.765
As they look around the lavish rooms,...

00:34.072 --> 00:38.540

00:43.051 --> 00:47.447
...crowds surging through the doors to get inside this presidential palace...

00:47.696 --> 00:52.122

00:57.081 --> 01:01.023
Protesters say they won't leave until the president officially quits.

01:01.565 --> 01:05.637
But even once he does, who can save this nation in need?

01:06.083 --> 01:09.041
For Sri Lanka, the challenges keep on coming.
