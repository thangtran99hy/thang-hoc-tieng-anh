Miyoko Shinner is a Japanese immigrant...

00:02.684 --> 00:04.827
...who has been a vegan for four decades.

00:05.055 --> 00:07.128
She has been making vegan cheese and butter...

00:07.341 --> 00:09.797
...since getting her start, teaching cooking classes...

00:09.864 --> 00:11.003
...and hosting a cooking show.

00:11.461 --> 00:13.253
After promoting her fourth cookbook,...

00:13.587 --> 00:15.701
...which featured cheese made from cashews,...

00:15.972 --> 00:18.476
...she started Miyoko's Creamery in 2014.

00:18.807 --> 00:20.511
The brand now sells alternatives...

00:20.613 --> 00:24.248
...to butter, cream cheese and mozzarella at 20,000 stores...

00:24.323 --> 00:25.854
...including Walmart and Target.

00:26.044 --> 00:29.894
So when I started it, I thought it was really just sort of a stab in the dark.

00:29.999 --> 00:32.145
Was it going to have any traction at all?

00:32.228 --> 00:33.903
Was anyone even going to buy the product?

00:34.303 --> 00:38.192
And I was just shocked when I found that the demand was so strong...

00:38.325 --> 00:41.095
...and then we just started growing at 100% year over year.

00:41.597 --> 00:47.623
Shinner now employs some 170 workers and has raised more than 20 million dollars.
