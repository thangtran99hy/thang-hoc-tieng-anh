00:00.331 --> 00:02.817
Monkeypox is a virus that causes fever...

00:02.919 --> 00:04.682
...and a distinctive bumpy rash.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.740
There are two main strains.

00:07.242 --> 00:11.379
The Congo strain is more severe with up to 10 percent mortality.

00:12.037 --> 00:15.683
The West African strain has a fatality rate of 1 percent.

00:15.881 --> 00:20.484
The virus was first found in monkeys in 1958, hence the name,...

00:20.933 --> 00:24.209
...but rodents are now seen as the main source of transmission.

00:24.743 --> 00:26.886
The virus spreads through close contact,...

00:27.078 --> 00:29.285
...both in spillovers from animal hosts...

00:29.593 --> 00:32.427
...and less commonly between humans.

00:33.107 --> 00:36.765
One likely scenario behind the jump in cases is increased travel...

00:36.869 --> 00:38.867
....after COVID restrictions were lifted.

00:39.859 --> 00:42.493
Monkeypox puts virologists on the alert...

00:42.667 --> 00:44.875
....because it is in the smallpox family,...

00:45.126 --> 00:47.382
...although it causes less serious illness.

00:47.971 --> 00:51.833
Smallpox was eradicated by vaccination in 1980...

00:51.957 --> 00:53.665
....and the shot has been phased out,...

00:54.132 --> 00:56.701
...but it also protects against monkeypox.
