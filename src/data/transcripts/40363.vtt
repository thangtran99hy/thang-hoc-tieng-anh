00:00.050 --> 00:00.967
When the pandemic hit,...

00:01.043 --> 00:03.691
...Jennifer, along with the Stockton -  San Joaquin Lions Club,...

00:03.779 --> 00:09.335
...began collecting plastic bags for an environmental initiative called Bags to Benches.

00:09.597 --> 00:12.950
People were having nowhere to take their plastic bags.

00:13.036 --> 00:16.897
People were getting everything delivered from Amazon and lots of bubble wrap,...

00:16.994 --> 00:18.775
...so we took that all in.

00:18.958 --> 00:20.667
So we thought, that's a win-win.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.700
We're protecting the planet and we're doing something good.

00:23.779 --> 00:28.487
Partnering with local drop-off sites and recycling centers, the Lions Club got to work.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.416
We go out, we pick up and empty those bins.

00:31.725 --> 00:34.039
We have to make sure the plastic is dry and clean.

00:34.125 --> 00:38.299
So if it's not clean, we have to wash it and dry it, have our own laundry line.

00:38.387 --> 00:44.576
And through their efforts, Jennifer's team brought in 1,475 pounds of plastic,...

00:44.879 --> 00:46.887
...enough to make this bench.

00:47.053 --> 00:50.101
I couldn't believe it was actually here, that it had arrived...

00:50.189 --> 00:54.814
...and I was thinking it might crumble under me because it was made from plastic,...

00:54.922 --> 00:57.662
...but they're actually really nice, sturdy composite benches.

00:57.739 --> 01:01.543
This instills in people that it's not waste.

01:01.832 --> 01:03.285
It is a valuable product.

01:03.449 --> 01:06.518
A plastic park bench encouraging you to kick up your feet...

01:06.635 --> 01:09.357
...in an effort to reduce your carbon footprint,...

01:09.653 --> 01:13.086
...for Jennifer, an effort she couldn't be more proud of.
