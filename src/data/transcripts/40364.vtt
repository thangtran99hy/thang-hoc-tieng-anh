When I started this project, my father looked at me like I had two heads.

00:06.467 --> 00:07.993
He was like, "What are you doing with all this plastic?"

00:09.085 --> 00:09.794
We're a leather company.

00:09.900 --> 00:10.599
We're a leather factory.

00:10.687 --> 00:12.895
We've been making leather goods for the last 35 years.

00:13.941 --> 00:16.649
Like in here, you have CVS bags.

00:16.963 --> 00:20.734
In here, you have a... these are ShopRite bags.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.869
When I introduced this idea to my employees,...

00:23.947 --> 00:25.488
...they all thought I was a little crazy as well.

00:26.303 --> 00:29.965
With each aNYbag, we use 95 single-use plastic bags...

00:30.047 --> 00:32.072
...or two pounds of plastic to make one bag.

00:33.233 --> 00:37.183
There's no machine out there that was made specifically for what we're doing.

00:37.336 --> 00:39.997
We're rigging all our leather machines to make this work.

00:42.094 --> 00:44.236
Each bag is individual to itself.

00:44.356 --> 00:45.790
Each bag is a different story.

00:46.161 --> 00:49.261
It's as authentic as you can get to New York City.

00:50.430 --> 00:53.428
So this is basically the last step where I just examine it,...

00:53.527 --> 00:56.183
...make sure everything was stitched up properly.

00:57.364 --> 00:58.303
And it's sturdy.

00:58.503 --> 01:00.200
Hammer it to give it the crease.

01:01.002 --> 01:01.614
And there you go.

01:03.253 --> 01:04.337
aNYbag is complete.

01:04.674 --> 01:07.884
With the aNYbag project, my goal is not to just clean up New York City.

01:07.961 --> 01:09.826
It's to clean up all cities and eventually the world,...

01:10.037 --> 01:11.850
...where we start building pop-up shops,...

01:11.919 --> 01:15.393
...little markets where we teach other people how to do this.
