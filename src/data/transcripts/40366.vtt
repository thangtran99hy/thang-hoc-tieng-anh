Every image is a new discovery...

00:02.530 --> 00:08.341
...and each will give humanity a view of the universe that we've never seen before.

00:08.837 --> 00:12.337
This image, as we're looking at it, what we're seeing is not just all the galaxies,...

00:12.443 --> 00:13.581
...but there's a cluster here.

00:14.122 --> 00:16.995
And you know, it's really, there's so much detail here.

00:17.097 --> 00:21.248
We're seeing these galaxies in a way that we've never been able to see before.

00:21.853 --> 00:23.651
These images are gonna remind the world...

00:23.933 --> 00:26.689
...that America can do big things...
