00:07.887 --> 00:11.478
This was a scene in Ishinomaki on that fateful day.

00:12.609 --> 00:14.877
The coastal city was one of the hardest hit,...

00:14.987 --> 00:17.155
...having lost more than 3,000 residents,...

00:17.793 --> 00:20.362
...84 of them were lost at this one school.

00:20.869 --> 00:24.871
Noriki lost his twelve-year-old daughter here in the 2011 tsunami.

00:24.967 --> 00:29.909
This behind me is what remains of her Okawa Elementary School where she attended.

00:30.152 --> 00:33.933
The water then came up to where that white sign is up on that hill...

00:34.017 --> 00:38.761
...and if the 84 of them had just evacuated above that white sign,...

00:38.860 --> 00:40.995
...then their lives could have been saved.

00:41.611 --> 00:45.776
Instead, the teachers led the students this way, the wrong direction,...

00:45.860 --> 00:50.555
...because this is a dead end and that's where the waves crashed over them.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.375
Noriki wants the world to know what happened here...

00:54.462 --> 00:58.330
...and says the Olympics torch relay was the perfect opportunity.

00:59.046 --> 01:02.319
He applied and was selected as one of the torchbearers...

01:02.403 --> 01:04.284
...who reflect the Olympic spirit.
