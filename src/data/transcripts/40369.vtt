00:00.633 --> 00:05.035
The gigantic earthquake of 2011 was followed by a devastating tsunami.

00:06.677 --> 00:11.919
The huge waves ripped up tracks, destroyed bridges and stations and drowned trains.

00:12.923 --> 00:15.639
The Sanriku Railway was brought to its knees.

00:20.310 --> 00:25.521
After the disaster, Sanriku Railways Atsushi Tomite came to survey the damage.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.005
One thing immediately caught his attention.

00:32.957 --> 00:36.385
The roads were impossible and all the cars had been washed away.

00:36.963 --> 00:40.891
Instead, people were getting about by walking along our railway tracks.

00:42.469 --> 00:44.699
At this moment, when everyone had lost hope,...

00:45.031 --> 00:48.459
...Tomite realized that the railway was still partly usable.

00:49.987 --> 00:51.608
We are a railway company.

00:52.087 --> 00:57.947
It was our duty to get our trains back into service again as quickly as possible.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.435
The engineers immediately set to work.

01:01.737 --> 01:05.426
Restoring even a short section of track would be a huge help.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.958
Just five days after the disaster,...

01:09.057 --> 01:12.771
...trains were running again along 11 kilometers of Sanriku Railway.

01:16.241 --> 01:20.585
By April 2014, three years after the disaster,...

01:21.233 --> 01:23.941
...the Sanriku Railway was fully operational again.

01:31.329 --> 01:33.885
The Sanriku Railway didn't achieve this on its own.

01:34.643 --> 01:39.104
We have to thank the commitment of the local community and everyone who came to help.
