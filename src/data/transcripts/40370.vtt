00:08.593 --> 00:11.011
So, of all the stadiums of 2019 Rugby World Cup,...

00:11.100 --> 00:14.718
...this is by far the smallest, with a capacity of 16 odd thousand seats,...

00:15.035 --> 00:16.764
...but by far the most important.

00:16.967 --> 00:18.009
We're here at Kamaishi,...

00:18.098 --> 00:21.433
...the Kamaishi Unosumai Recovery Memorial Stadium.

00:21.611 --> 00:24.587
This stadium is being specifically built to help this city...

00:24.672 --> 00:25.500
...get back on its feet.

00:26.029 --> 00:27.195
And if you look up here,...

00:27.281 --> 00:29.570
...you can actually see all the valleys...

00:29.692 --> 00:32.017
...where the wall of water would have come straight through here.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.662
I can't even picture a 40-meter wall of seawater...

00:35.773 --> 00:37.483
...just rushing straight in through here.

00:37.595 --> 00:39.659
And this is literally where the school used to be,...

00:40.064 --> 00:43.311
...and I ran up to that hill over there to get to safety.

00:43.495 --> 00:44.645
It would have just been terrifying...

00:44.769 --> 00:48.614
...and you can't even imagine the sheer terror of that coming through here.

00:50.489 --> 00:53.717
Seeing the city being rebuilt for the 2019 Rugby World Cup...

00:53.816 --> 00:55.715
...is a truly humbling experience...

00:55.827 --> 00:58.609
...and I can't wait to see the games played here.
