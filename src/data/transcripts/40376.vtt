Excuse me.

00:02.235 --> 00:02.853
Yes?

00:03.323 --> 00:06.758
I heard there is bus service from here to Brian Park Skate Rink...

00:07.185 --> 00:08.801
...and I want to know the bus schedule.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.205
How often does the bus operate in the daytime?

00:12.979 --> 00:17.787
The bus from Brian Park operates every thirty minutes from 10:00 AM through 3:00 PM.

00:18.483 --> 00:20.328
Here is the bus schedule so you can check it.

00:21.038 --> 00:22.602
Good. This is helpful.

00:23.205 --> 00:24.771
And how much is the bus fare?

00:25.211 --> 00:28.525
It is 2 dollars for an adult, and 90 cents for a kid.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.362
The bus in the morning on weekends is rather crowded these days.

00:32.757 --> 00:34.214
Thank you for the information.
