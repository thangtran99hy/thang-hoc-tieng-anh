00:00.050 --> 00:02.309
Electric cars, they're nothing new.

00:02.613 --> 00:04.373
Porsche has been wired since way back.

00:04.658 --> 00:08.731
This was 100 percent electric 100 years before that was cool.

00:09.246 --> 00:11.849
But this? Yeah, this is new.

00:12.315 --> 00:15.743
It's called the Taycan, Porsche's first fully electric sports car.

00:16.716 --> 00:20.163
Big step? Nah, more of a giant leap.

00:20.622 --> 00:24.585
It charges fast, feels fast, goes fast and you still drive it like a Porsche.

00:24.959 --> 00:28.252
Kids, luggage, friends you like, friends you don't like,...

00:28.493 --> 00:29.701
Taycan can handle it all.

00:29.811 --> 00:31.842
Want to go hundreds of miles on a charge?

00:31.967 --> 00:32.326
Get in.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.425
In the Taycan, the kilowatt is king.

00:34.689 --> 00:38.079
Plug in, charge up, text your mom, scroll the feed, boom, done.

00:38.355 --> 00:41.902
Rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, sedan or wagon, any color you want.

00:42.034 --> 00:45.475
Match your eyes, match your dog's eyes, match my eyes.

00:45.806 --> 00:47.675
It's silent, smooth, powerful.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.133
It's everything Porsche has learned from the road, from the tracks, from the family.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.211
See what I'm saying?

00:52.900 --> 00:55.037
Same Porsche, different energy.
