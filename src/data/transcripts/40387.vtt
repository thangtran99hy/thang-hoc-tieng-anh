It's Pevan and Sarah.

00:10.653 --> 00:13.338
The sun is shining and it's a beautiful day.

00:14.063 --> 00:16.051
I think it's time to play outside.

00:16.732 --> 00:18.449
Would you like to play catch, Sarah?

00:24.347 --> 00:26.147
OK, get ready to catch.

00:44.089 --> 00:45.783
Sarah, are you hurt?

00:46.929 --> 00:48.541
Did the world explode?

00:49.780 --> 00:52.931
Is this the worst thing that could ever happen to you?

00:53.243 --> 00:54.583
You only dropped a ball.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.485
Making mistakes is an important part of learning.

00:58.846 --> 01:01.605
You need to just focus on catching the ball...

01:01.903 --> 01:03.804
...and don't take your eyes off it.

01:04.536 --> 01:06.247
Do you think you've learned something now?

01:06.829 --> 01:07.998
Let's try again.

01:08.686 --> 01:09.510
All right?

01:09.795 --> 01:11.759
Focus and eyes on the ball.

01:12.220 --> 01:13.252
Ready to catch.

01:16.442 --> 01:17.001
See?

01:17.519 --> 01:19.284
You did learn something.

01:19.697 --> 01:21.840
You learned from your mistakes.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.859
Well done, Sarah.

01:26.537 --> 01:30.725
And remember, Cubs, it's okay to make mistakes.
