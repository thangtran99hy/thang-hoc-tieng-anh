In January 2021, General Motors made a stunning announcement.

00:05.262 --> 00:11.735
It aspires to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035,...

00:12.124 --> 00:16.547
…meaning that GM intends to stop selling gas burning cars.

00:17.221 --> 00:20.620
GM executives have made announcements over the past several years...

00:20.700 --> 00:23.819
…touting the carmaker's commitment to an all electric future.

00:24.273 --> 00:29.678
Of course, rivals such as Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker by a long shot,...

00:29.871 --> 00:32.244
…sell nothing but electric cars.

00:32.738 --> 00:36.713
GM plans to introduce 30 EVs by 2025.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.060
They can't just sit back and wait for the market to come.

00:40.184 --> 00:43.028
They are going to have to push the market forward...

00:43.190 --> 00:45.596
…because if they don't do it, there are others who will.

00:45.735 --> 00:50.035
GM executives emphasized the company's plan to be completely emission free...

00:50.109 --> 00:52.002
...is a goal and not a guarantee.

00:52.389 --> 00:55.987
But even with the walk back, GM's plan has skeptics.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.941
Concerns linger among auto industry insiders...

00:59.011 --> 01:02.018
…that consumers are still skittish about buying EVs.

01:02.137 --> 01:04.099
We really want to hear from those customers...

01:04.183 --> 01:06.870
…because we think we can address all of that skeptics.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.821
Vehicle ranges are improving,...

01:09.086 --> 01:12.733
…but charging an EV still takes a lot longer than filling a gas tank.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.313
And many areas, don't have a lot of charging stations,...

01:15.391 --> 01:17.983
…especially when compared with the number of gas stations.

01:18.193 --> 01:21.689
GM is not the only one that has made a big commitment to electric vehicles,...

01:22.017 --> 01:25.599
…but some other automakers are spreading their bets out among electric,...

01:25.713 --> 01:29.315
…hybrid, and even more efficient internal combustion engines.
