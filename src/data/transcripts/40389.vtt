In 2021, over 360,000 people left California...

00:06.357 --> 00:09.401
...in what many are calling the "California exodus,"...

00:09.584 --> 00:13.493
...leaving for states like Texas, Arizona, and Washington.

00:13.693 --> 00:17.449
But a rising number of them are migrating out of the country altogether,...

00:17.657 --> 00:20.304
...and instead heading south of the border.

00:20.567 --> 00:25.639

00:38.596 --> 00:41.983

...to just meet the bare minimum.

00:44.364 --> 00:49.336
California's population growth has been declining for over 30 years now,...

00:49.518 --> 00:51.533
...but thanks to the rise in remote work,...

00:51.647 --> 00:55.869
...due to the Covid-19 pandemic, those trends have accelerated.

00:56.077 --> 01:02.435
