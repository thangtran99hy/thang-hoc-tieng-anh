00:06.135 --> 00:07.312
I gotta get to school.

00:07.659 --> 00:10.504
I never should have stopped and picked all those blueberries.

00:11.661 --> 00:12.818
Whoa.

00:13.835 --> 00:15.562
Hunter, what's going on?

00:16.233 --> 00:18.021
Look at that flooded creek.

00:18.323 --> 00:19.528
I'm done for.

00:20.165 --> 00:21.785
This is a big problem.

00:22.316 --> 00:23.142
I give up.

00:23.780 --> 00:24.459
Wait a minute.

00:24.595 --> 00:28.018
Let's talk this through and make sure we understand the problem.

00:28.337 --> 00:30.222
Maybe we can come up with a solution.

00:31.189 --> 00:35.005
Well, the problem is that because of all the rain,...

00:35.110 --> 00:38.281
...I can't safely cross the flooded creek and get to school.

00:38.654 --> 00:41.371
Okay, now that we understand the problem.

00:41.534 --> 00:44.969
Let's see if we can come up with some solutions for getting to school safely.

00:46.993 --> 00:48.021
Let me think.

00:48.630 --> 00:52.675
How could I solve this problem and find a way to get to school safely?

00:53.605 --> 00:54.420
I got it.

00:54.969 --> 00:56.948
Would you fly me over the creek, Eve?

00:57.823 --> 01:01.037
Hunter, I'd love to, but owls can't fly very well in the rain.

01:01.182 --> 01:03.609
I'll have to stay under this tree until it stops.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.189
Oh well, I'm stuck.

01:06.693 --> 01:08.015
No use trying.

01:08.397 --> 01:09.591
Problems can be tricky,...

01:09.731 --> 01:10.817
...but you're smart.

01:10.939 --> 01:13.994
I know that together we can find a way across that creek.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.201
Okay, let me think some more.

01:25.270 --> 01:27.003
Well, that won't work.

01:28.807 --> 01:29.783
Maybe...

01:36.027 --> 01:37.333
What if I fall in?

01:37.678 --> 01:40.409
My mom said never to swim in rushing water.

01:48.284 --> 01:49.623
Yikes.

01:51.665 --> 01:53.499
I don't know what to do, Eve.

01:53.684 --> 01:54.256
I give up.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.149
Hunter, don't give up.

01:56.278 --> 01:57.430
Keep trying.

01:59.339 --> 02:02.904
Well, there is a brand new bridge up the creek.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.321
It's a longer walk to school than usual,...

02:05.578 --> 02:07.456
...but the beavers built it high and sturdy,...

02:07.697 --> 02:10.359
...so I'm sure it's safe and not flooded.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.881
Great job, Hunter!

02:12.159 --> 02:15.198
I think you've come up with a good and safe solution.
