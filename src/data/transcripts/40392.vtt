00:11.864 --> 00:12.479
Eve?

00:12.915 --> 00:14.173
Eve, where are you?

00:14.415 --> 00:15.159
Yes, Hunter.

00:15.321 --> 00:16.071
I'm right here.

00:16.319 --> 00:17.414
Is everything okay?

00:17.727 --> 00:20.575
I'm trying to stay calm, but I think I'm stuck.

00:20.857 --> 00:23.611
The snow is so deep, I can't wiggle my way out.

00:23.947 --> 00:26.091
Well, you're doing a great job keeping calm.

00:26.423 --> 00:28.406
Let's take a breath and figure this out.

00:31.701 --> 00:34.181
Now, do you know how to get help when you need it?

00:34.550 --> 00:35.600
How do I do that?

00:35.789 --> 00:37.653
Well, when you recognize you need help,...

00:37.934 --> 00:39.971
...think about a safe person who might help you.

00:41.089 --> 00:42.605
Can you help me, Eve?

00:43.063 --> 00:44.630
I would love to help you, Hunter,...

00:44.734 --> 00:47.101
...but I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to fly you out of there.

00:47.351 --> 00:48.467
Any other ideas?

00:50.119 --> 00:51.673
Hey, there's Mr. Garcia.

00:52.003 --> 00:54.495
He's my next door neighbor and is really nice.

00:55.023 --> 00:56.974
Plus, he's really strong.

00:58.153 --> 00:59.421
What should I say?

00:59.781 --> 01:03.292
Ask for help by explaining what you are trying to do or what you need.

01:03.533 --> 01:06.869
Okay, but what if he says no or he can't help?

01:07.193 --> 01:08.473
It never hurts to ask.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.027
Just be polite.

01:10.293 --> 01:13.537
You will be surprised how often others are willing to help you.

01:14.637 --> 01:17.066
Excuse me, Mr. Garcia.

01:18.257 --> 01:19.330
Hey, little buddy.

01:19.622 --> 01:20.283
What's up?

01:21.226 --> 01:22.415
I think I'm stuck.

01:23.085 --> 01:24.750
Would you mind pulling me out?

01:25.093 --> 01:26.387
Sure, no problem.

01:26.872 --> 01:28.296
Hold still.

01:29.944 --> 01:32.415
Hunter, do you know what step three is?

01:32.643 --> 01:34.009
I bet I can guess.

01:34.824 --> 01:38.195
Step three is to say thanks for the help you receive.

01:39.067 --> 01:40.595
Thank you, Mr. Garcia.

01:40.944 --> 01:41.763
Very good.

01:41.911 --> 01:43.347
I couldn't have said it better myself.
