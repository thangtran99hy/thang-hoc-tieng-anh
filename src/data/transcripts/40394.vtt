00:00.050 --> 00:03.694
On average, men die about seven years earlier than women,...

00:03.997 --> 00:07.583
...and male lions, rodents, and spiders often go belly up...

00:07.700 --> 00:09.353
...before their female counterparts too.

00:09.808 --> 00:13.083
One big reason males live shorter lives than females...

00:13.195 --> 00:18.016
...might be hidden away in the chromosomes that help determine sex in the first place.

00:18.465 --> 00:19.639
Welcome to MinuteEarth.

00:20.184 --> 00:23.903
In lots of species, males are more aggressive and take more risks,...

00:24.016 --> 00:26.250
...so you might expect they'd die first...

00:26.446 --> 00:29.211
...and in many species like humans, they do.

00:29.682 --> 00:31.733
But males aren't always more aggressive,...

00:31.900 --> 00:34.609
...and the more aggressive sex doesn't always die first.

00:34.896 --> 00:37.114
Instead, when you look across the animal kingdom,...

00:37.193 --> 00:40.161
...the animals that die earlier, regardless of their sex,...

00:40.255 --> 00:41.685
...have something else in common:...

00:41.953 --> 00:43.863
...they have a small sex chromosome.

00:44.331 --> 00:48.262
Sex chromosomes generally come in two sizes: big and small.

00:48.502 --> 00:51.025
Part of what determines the sex of an individual...

00:51.116 --> 00:53.626
...is the combination of sizes they inherit.

00:53.884 --> 00:57.643
In mammals like humans, females inherit two big sex chromosomes,...

00:57.767 --> 01:00.246
...while males inherit one big and one small.

01:00.482 --> 01:03.583
But in birds, butterflies, and some reptiles and amphibians,...

01:03.725 --> 01:04.650
...the opposite is true:...

01:04.895 --> 01:08.161
...males get two bigs, while females get a big and a small.

01:08.551 --> 01:12.827
In most cases, the sex with the small chromosome tends to die first...

01:12.967 --> 01:15.729
...regardless of whether they are the males or females.
