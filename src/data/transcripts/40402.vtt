Some familiar faces were missing...

00:03.409 --> 00:05.986
...at a brand new shopping center in Moscow.

00:06.399 --> 00:08.660
Western companies like McDonald's and Adidas...

00:08.913 --> 00:10.448
...largely pulled out of Russia...

00:10.537 --> 00:12.705
...after the conflict began in Ukraine.

00:13.208 --> 00:16.073
But some locals at the newly opened Khovrino mall...

00:16.321 --> 00:18.226
...claimed they were hardly missed.

00:18.815 --> 00:22.501
Consumers were happy to buy, but not all stores were ready to sell.

00:22.725 --> 00:24.683
Some companies faced what officials called...

00:24.801 --> 00:27.978
...acute issues with logistics and deliveries.

00:28.671 --> 00:30.879
One industry group claims Russian malls...

00:30.955 --> 00:33.219
...have lost around 30% of footfall...

00:33.286 --> 00:34.520
...since Western brands left.

00:34.849 --> 00:37.940
Fried chicken chain KFC is one of the last to be seen.

00:38.327 --> 00:41.224
Most of its Russian branches are independent franchises...

00:41.372 --> 00:44.533
...over which parent company Yum Brands has little control.

00:45.037 --> 00:48.843
Even so, officials from the new mall are positive about the future.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.653
They believe 15,000 people per day...

00:51.789 --> 00:55.099
...could visit once the center is fully operational.
