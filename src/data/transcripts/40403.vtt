Hello there.

00:01.631 --> 00:03.098
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:03.488 --> 00:05.073
Crikey, a black cat!

00:05.357 --> 00:06.908
He's gonna bring me bad luck.

00:07.439 --> 00:09.819
Shows what you know about luck.

00:14.961 --> 00:16.259
Let's drop some knowledge.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.108
Luck is different all around the world.

00:19.207 --> 00:23.517
Like in Scotland where a black cat like me is considered very lucky.

00:23.829 --> 00:26.136
Remember kids, don't try this at home.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.378
Name's Bob, by the way...

00:28.531 --> 00:31.126
...and this is the Land of Luck.

00:31.524 --> 00:32.293
Morning, Gerry.

00:32.961 --> 00:37.069
We work behind the scenes to create those wee lucky and unlucky moments...

00:37.155 --> 00:39.007
...that make up your everyday life.

00:40.420 --> 00:43.626
Like these guys, an entire team thinking up the jammy work...

00:43.861 --> 00:46.794
...that kinda makes you feel like a million bucks.

00:47.097 --> 00:48.867
Okay, maybe a hundred bucks.

00:49.194 --> 00:51.146
Of course, then there's the other team...

00:51.634 --> 00:53.851
...working on the not so jammy kind of luck,...

00:54.093 --> 00:56.585
...and they sure love what they do.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.776
Well, you humans are a complicated lot...

01:00.900 --> 01:03.068
...and that's why things run so smoothly here...

01:03.183 --> 01:06.091
because no human has ever set foot in this place.

01:06.253 --> 01:08.793
And with a little bit of luck, they never will.

01:13.828 --> 01:16.258
Uh, where am I?

01:17.521 --> 01:19.029
Oh, you got to be kidding.
