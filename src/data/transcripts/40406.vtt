Similes.

00:03.512 --> 00:10.269
Similes compare one thing to another using the words "like" or "as."

00:11.309 --> 00:15.732
For example, if we say, "My aunt is as busy as a bee",...

00:15.879 --> 00:18.793
...we're not really saying that my aunt is a bee.

00:19.177 --> 00:24.299
However, we're comparing how busy she is to how busy bees are.

00:25.402 --> 00:29.834
My brother ran as fast as lightning to catch the bus.

00:30.597 --> 00:33.165
Here, we're comparing my brother's running...

00:33.381 --> 00:36.364
...and saying that it is fast as lightning.

00:37.349 --> 00:41.300
Her eyes sparkled like diamonds when she saw her new toy.

00:41.899 --> 00:45.557
In this example, we're comparing the excitement in her eyes...

00:45.644 --> 00:49.061
...over her new toy to the sparkling of diamonds.

00:50.379 --> 00:52.855
The cookies were as hard as a rock.

00:53.510 --> 00:58.221
Here, we're comparing how hard the cookies were to the hardness of a rock.

00:59.339 --> 01:01.887
Writers and authors use similes...

01:01.964 --> 01:07.797
...to make their writing more descriptive, vivid, interesting and fun.
