00:01.106 --> 00:03.425
No experience, no resume,...

00:03.835 --> 00:08.159
...no problem at all in some of Europe's top tourist destinations.

00:08.631 --> 00:11.711
Hotels, bars and restaurants in Spain and Portugal...

00:11.774 --> 00:14.297
...are fighting a fierce war for staff.

00:14.761 --> 00:17.501
Waiters and other workers are in such short supply...

00:17.591 --> 00:21.352
...that firms are willing to hire almost anyone willing to join.

00:21.921 --> 00:24.503
There shouldn't be a shortage of job seekers,...

00:24.625 --> 00:30.161
...with youth unemployment above 20% in Portugal and near 30% in Spain.

00:30.747 --> 00:33.601
But workers and unions blame unsociable hours,...

00:33.707 --> 00:38.381
...low pay and short contracts for putting people off the hospitality sector.

00:38.992 --> 00:44.038
That leaves Spain's catering trade alone short of 200,000 workers.

00:44.722 --> 00:50.457
It's a similar story over in Portugal, where hotels need another 15,000 staff.

00:51.073 --> 00:53.395
The shortages come at a bad time,...

00:53.480 --> 00:56.588
...with demand rebounding after years of lockdowns.

00:57.051 --> 01:00.415
Searches for summer flights to Spain and Portugal have jumped...

01:00.503 --> 01:03.943
...as much as 156 percent from last year.

01:04.407 --> 01:08.987
Travel looks set to match or surpass pre-health crisis levels.

01:09.662 --> 01:12.789
The tourists want to come to Spain and Portugal,...

01:13.249 --> 01:17.213
...but bars and hotels may not be ready to welcome them.
