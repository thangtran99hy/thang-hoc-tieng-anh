00:01.723 --> 00:02.253
Goodnight buddy.

00:02.611 --> 00:02.932
Goodnight.

00:03.131 --> 00:03.481
See you in the morning.

00:03.861 --> 00:04.049
Yep.

00:05.721 --> 00:08.619
Dad, are you really going to defeat the Ender Dragon?

00:08.957 --> 00:09.658
I'm gonna try, buddy.

00:10.038 --> 00:10.469
Goodnight.

00:10.629 --> 00:10.947
Goodnight.

00:16.053 --> 00:17.735
Alright, I'm at the end portal.

00:18.107 --> 00:18.553
You with me?

00:18.799 --> 00:19.697
Hey guys, I'm here.

00:20.110 --> 00:21.155
Everybody have enough arrows?

00:21.754 --> 00:22.898
Yeah, yeah, I got the arrows.

00:23.149 --> 00:24.503
Hold on, I'm getting some carrots.

00:24.796 --> 00:25.510
Seriously?

00:25.855 --> 00:26.599
They're good for your health.

00:26.809 --> 00:27.379
Almost there.

00:27.603 --> 00:28.305
I'm going in.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.295
Let's keep going.

00:29.925 --> 00:31.208
He was dead weight anyways.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.595
Almost got him, almost got him.

00:34.047 --> 00:35.158
I'm taking too much damage.

00:35.298 --> 00:35.823
One more hit.

00:37.902 --> 00:38.366
Yes!

00:38.580 --> 00:39.120
Who got him?

00:39.367 --> 00:40.011
Who is that?

00:42.527 --> 00:43.523
I know who it is.

00:43.707 --> 00:44.501
I couldn't sleep.

00:45.014 --> 00:45.747
Thanks for the assist!

00:45.941 --> 00:46.475
Thanks!

00:47.131 --> 00:48.144
It was a good job, kiddo.

00:48.334 --> 00:49.481
We won, we won!

00:49.656 --> 00:50.760
That was awesome!

00:50.902 --> 00:51.492
Ah, OK, made it!

00:51.983 --> 00:52.801
Where's this dragon?

00:53.212 --> 00:54.014
We already did it.

00:54.301 --> 00:55.023
You're late.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.175
Maybe wait for me next time.

00:58.586 --> 01:00.827
Getting a little help from my little guy.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.584
That's my way to play.

01:02.873 --> 01:03.963
Nintendo Switch.
