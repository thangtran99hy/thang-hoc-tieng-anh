00:01.924 --> 00:02.313
Kia ora.

00:04.265 --> 00:05.183
What are you doing in here?

00:05.309 --> 00:07.861
You're having a dream about New Zealand, my Australian friend...

00:08.170 --> 00:08.913
...and I'm in it.

00:09.167 --> 00:10.241
That makes sense.

00:10.774 --> 00:12.975
I have been dreaming of going  to New Zealand.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.807
Can I have a dream beard?

00:16.135 --> 00:20.492
Yeah, sure. Let's go!

00:21.416 --> 00:25.201
This is my favorite part!

00:27.260 --> 00:33.789
Everyone in here is me.

00:33.943 --> 00:34.614
Except for Di.

00:35.651 --> 00:36.299
Kia ora, Di!

00:36.567 --> 00:37.183
Kia ora, Ty!

00:37.567 --> 00:39.924
She's doing another Australian's fresh crayfish dream.

00:40.145 --> 00:42.087
I'm in another Aussie's dream?

00:42.424 --> 00:45.169
It's actually quite a complicated complex crayfish crossover,...

00:45.339 --> 00:46.427
...but if you don't think about it,...

00:47.567 --> 00:48.023
...just pedal.

00:48.205 --> 00:48.553
Pedal?

00:53.401 --> 00:55.906
Lovely.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.449
Are all kiwis that big?

01:08.765 --> 01:10.357
Nah, that's a dream kiwi.

01:11.199 --> 01:12.008
Don't look at it in the eyes!

01:17.764 --> 01:18.653
My beard!

01:20.332 --> 01:22.143
I don't want this dream to be over.

01:22.269 --> 01:24.295
It doesn't have to be, my little hairless buddy!

01:24.416 --> 01:25.503
Just book a ticket!

01:26.104 --> 01:26.879
Come on, kiwi!
