00:02.065 --> 00:05.049
Farms around the world are struggling to protect their crops.

00:05.931 --> 00:09.666
The price of synthetic fertilizers is soaring due to the war in Ukraine...

00:10.209 --> 00:11.957
...and supply chain disruptions.

00:13.447 --> 00:17.085
But farmers in Vermont are finding relief from an unexpected source:...

00:18.223 --> 00:19.153
...human pee.

00:20.642 --> 00:23.411
Dean Hamilton is one of a handful of farmers in the area...

00:23.489 --> 00:25.697
...participating in an experimental program...

00:26.190 --> 00:28.638
...trading chemical fertilizers for human urine.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.622
The liquid is rich in phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium,...

00:32.607 --> 00:35.399
...important nutrients that the plants need to thrive.

00:35.525 --> 00:37.409
About 80% of the nitrogen...

00:37.500 --> 00:41.063
...and 2/3 of the phosphorus in our bodily waste are in the urine,...

00:41.151 --> 00:42.001
...which surprises people.

00:42.129 --> 00:46.657
The Rich Earth Institute started the urine nutrient reclamation program in 2012.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.199
The urine has nutrients in it.

00:48.433 --> 00:51.155
If you put those nutrients on the grass, they grow.

00:51.380 --> 00:52.347
There's more grass.

00:52.433 --> 00:54.179
More grass means more cows.

00:54.348 --> 00:55.416
The beef is cheaper.

00:56.786 --> 00:59.943
The whole system is more tied together, more cyclical.

01:00.179 --> 01:01.447
Everybody wins.
