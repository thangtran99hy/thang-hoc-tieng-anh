Let's say you're scrolling through Facebook and oh, look, another shocking headline.

00:06.253 --> 00:08.193
So shocking that it must be false.

00:08.790 --> 00:12.082
But, this time, it kind of looks true.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.562
You're not alone if you've had this dilemma.

00:15.195 --> 00:18.910
Here's how to spot fake and misleading information online.

00:22.535 --> 00:26.393
For posts that link to a website, first, check what the website's domain is.

00:26.748 --> 00:30.473
.edu and .gov are generally considered to be trustworthy.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.473
When it comes to news articles,...

00:32.627 --> 00:35.123
...check what news outlet the information is coming from.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.796
Is it from a well-known and trustworthy source?

00:38.339 --> 00:42.453
If you're skeptical, the easiest thing to do is search for the same story elsewhere.

00:42.941 --> 00:46.376
If other reputable outlets have covered it, the story is more reliable.

00:47.355 --> 00:48.517
When vetting posts,...

00:48.681 --> 00:52.426
...it's also important to check the date that the article or tweet was first published.

00:52.814 --> 00:55.254
Headlines can sometimes appear to be relevant,...

00:55.439 --> 00:59.007
...but the actual story or tweet is outdated or out of context...

00:59.192 --> 01:00.607
...and therefore misleading.

01:01.323 --> 01:03.268
For posts by individual users,...

01:03.446 --> 01:06.403
...look to see if that user has a blue check mark next to their name.

01:06.714 --> 01:09.745
The check mark means that Facebook and Twitter have verified the account...

01:09.826 --> 01:13.591
...is run by a real person or organization that matches the username.

01:14.461 --> 01:16.698
It's important to combine all these steps together...

01:16.837 --> 01:18.515
...to be able to make the best judgment.

01:19.077 --> 01:23.157
And lastly, if you're unsure about information you see on your social media,...

01:23.405 --> 01:25.543
...at the very least, don't repost it.

01:25.900 --> 01:30.441
Sharing information that you can't confirm is true will only make you part of the problem.
