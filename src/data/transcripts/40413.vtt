00:03.509 --> 00:04.913
My name is Redd Pepper.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.457
I'm a voice-over artist.

00:06.827 --> 00:10.701
In the UK, I've voiced hundreds of movie trailers.

00:11.106 --> 00:15.176
Men in Black, saving the earth from the scum of the universe;...

00:15.332 --> 00:21.217
...Blair Witch Project, Armageddon, Space Jam, Mr. Bean's Holiday.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.243
So many I forget half of them, to be honest with you.

00:24.705 --> 00:29.312
I started doing television adverts, animations, audiobooks.

00:29.715 --> 00:31.345
I do a lot of video games as well,...

00:31.443 --> 00:34.521
...and a lot of them are sound effects and ghouls in the background.

00:38.059 --> 00:39.671
Mr. Bean.

00:39.851 --> 00:44.015
When I first started doing movie trailers, it was fun.

00:44.350 --> 00:48.173
"One Man, coming soon to a cinema near you."

00:48.384 --> 00:50.381
Sometimes, I do romantic movies.

00:50.803 --> 00:52.009
"In a sleepy town"...

00:52.356 --> 00:53.764
Sometimes, I'm doing horror.

00:54.313 --> 00:55.979
"Don't answer the door."

00:56.293 --> 00:57.513
You got to use your voice.

00:57.614 --> 00:58.944
You got to raise it sometimes...

00:59.155 --> 01:00.935
...and you got to take it to the depths.

01:01.143 --> 01:04.195
Very occasionally I get recognized, but generally no.

01:04.354 --> 01:06.143
But the time I do get recognized,...

01:06.454 --> 01:08.559
...phone goes off in the train, guaranteed...

01:09.242 --> 01:09.895
Hello.

01:10.107 --> 01:12.415
...and people look up from behind the newspapers.

01:13.337 --> 01:17.009
The way I got into being a voice artist was kind of strange.

01:17.379 --> 01:19.892
I used to drive trains on the London Underground.

01:20.099 --> 01:22.420
One morning, I was making my announcements.

01:22.703 --> 01:24.286
"All stations to Harrow.

01:24.817 --> 01:26.066
Mind the doors."

01:26.207 --> 01:29.324
A television executive was a passenger on my train.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.324
He got off at the next stop, ran up to my cab,...

01:32.631 --> 01:35.365
...we exchanged details and the rest is history.

01:36.187 --> 01:37.475
I appreciate what I do.

01:37.567 --> 01:39.247
I'm still meticulous about what I do.

01:39.417 --> 01:40.699
I'm still proud of what I do.

01:40.903 --> 01:42.993
I really don't look at it as a job.

01:43.665 --> 01:44.937
I'm having fun.

01:45.325 --> 01:47.481
It really is a cool job.

01:47.563 --> 01:51.757
It's got to be up there with one of the coolest jobs on the planet, right?

01:51.947 --> 01:52.275
You got it?

01:52.605 --> 01:53.103
Cool.

01:53.251 --> 01:53.975
I'm out of here.
