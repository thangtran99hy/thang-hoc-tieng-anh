There is only one Billionaires' Row in the world,...

00:02.931 --> 00:04.351
...and it's in New York City...

00:04.798 --> 00:07.717
...and it's on 57th Street, and it's all for profit.

00:09.061 --> 00:13.716
It is a safety deposit in the sky for some of the richest people in the world.

00:13.925 --> 00:18.755
Some of the buildings on Billionaires' Row are quite beautiful and amazing constructs.

00:19.091 --> 00:21.635
But we're at a moment in society...

00:21.751 --> 00:26.829
...where there's a widespread great reckoning with the abuses of power...

00:26.925 --> 00:28.761
...and the concentrations of wealth.

00:31.269 --> 00:33.033
I hope that in ten years time,...

00:33.381 --> 00:37.965
...we look back at Billionaire's Row as a phenomenal mistake...

00:38.449 --> 00:41.581
...and a dozen missed opportunities.

00:42.173 --> 00:45.151
And the most important thing that I hope comes out of Billionaires' Row...

00:45.233 --> 00:48.160
...is that the city changes the way that it taxes property,...

00:48.293 --> 00:50.305
...changes the way that it does incentive zoning...

00:50.660 --> 00:55.563
...to actually get the most, and a fair distribution of payments.
