00:00.158 --> 00:02.677
So, these food delivery apps are still growing.

00:02.771 --> 00:04.665
They're just growing more slowly.

00:04.967 --> 00:08.499
So, what are companies like DoorDash and Uber Eats doing...

00:08.586 --> 00:10.231
...to keep customers spending money?

00:10.891 --> 00:14.839
Right, so, they have rolled out a host of measures this year.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.835
One is just they sweetening the deal...

00:18.139 --> 00:21.577
...to try to convince customers to become subscribers.

00:21.653 --> 00:26.976
Now, subscribers pay a monthly fee, but they enjoy discounts on food.

00:27.064 --> 00:28.932
They enjoy no delivery fees.

00:29.349 --> 00:31.358
And from the company's perspective,...

00:31.617 --> 00:35.539
...subscribers actually spend a lot more than non-subscribers,...

00:35.966 --> 00:38.673
...and they have higher-order values.

00:38.967 --> 00:43.050
So, it's in their best interest to get as many customers to become subscribers.

00:43.424 --> 00:47.145
And then, what the apps are also doing is they're tweaking their apps...

00:47.233 --> 00:48.703
...to trigger more spending...

00:48.783 --> 00:52.469
...and moving beyond food to give people more reasons to return.

00:52.541 --> 00:57.115
So, you know, you can now order everything from toothpaste to toilet paper...

00:57.199 --> 00:59.133
...to your groceries to flowers,...

00:59.199 --> 01:04.421
...even a Thanksgiving turkey on, you know, DoorDash and Uber Eats.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.913
And as far as restaurants are concerned,...

01:07.078 --> 01:13.429
...they're negotiating deals to keep them from increasing delivery prices.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.945
So, DoorDash negotiated a deal with McDonald's,...

01:16.033 --> 01:21.685
...where they can't raise delivery prices more than 30% of what the in-store price is.

01:22.093 --> 01:25.449
And at the same time, they are also diversifying beyond delivery...

01:25.751 --> 01:28.015
...and offering new services to restaurants.
