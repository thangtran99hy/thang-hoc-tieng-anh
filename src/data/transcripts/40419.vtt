Airlander is the world's most efficient large aircraft.

00:04.309 --> 00:08.354
It's designed to deliver ten tons of freight, 100 passengers...

00:08.695 --> 00:11.559
...and to deliver them to places or take them to places...

00:11.628 --> 00:14.624
...at only 10 percent the emissions of other aircraft.

00:14.931 --> 00:18.179
What we do with Airlander is combine some of those technologies...

00:18.261 --> 00:19.887
...that were in airships in the past,...

00:19.972 --> 00:22.267
...but we put that together with a lifting wing.

00:23.093 --> 00:25.941
We used modern materials and modern technologies...

00:26.177 --> 00:28.058
...to give us an airplane that's super efficient,...

00:28.615 --> 00:31.413
...but still takes off and lands from the ground like other airplanes.

00:31.719 --> 00:33.345
Different to airships, which, of course, float,...

00:33.719 --> 00:36.458
...the experience is totally different for a passenger.

00:36.567 --> 00:42.488
We think of Airlander as much as a fast ferry because it's big; it's spacious.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.262
Every seat is accessible to the aisle.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.323
You can move around.

00:46.036 --> 00:49.555
Big windows, flying much lower; it's very gentle,...

00:49.649 --> 00:53.578
...so none of that vibration and turbulence that we're used to in other aircraft.
