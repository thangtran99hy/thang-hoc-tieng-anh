From my many wanderings on this earth...

00:08.335 --> 00:15.211
...I had so much to say about imperfect fathers and imperfect sons...

00:16.515 --> 00:20.551
...and about loss and love.

00:23.165 --> 00:24.992
I've learned that there are old spirits...

00:25.107 --> 00:27.443
...who rarely involve themselves in the human world.

00:27.844 --> 00:29.786
But on occasion, they do.

00:32.310 --> 00:33.875
I want to tell you a story.

00:34.377 --> 00:38.364
It's a story you may think you know, but you don't.

00:39.523 --> 00:46.749
A story of the wooden boy.
