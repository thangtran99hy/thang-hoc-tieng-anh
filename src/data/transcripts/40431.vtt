Japan has some of the longest working hours in the world.

00:05.829 --> 00:07.633
Nearly a quarter of Japanese companies...

00:07.717 --> 00:11.225
...have their employees work more than 80 hours of overtime per month.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.499
Those extra hours are often unpaid.

00:13.722 --> 00:17.609
Today, Japan's corporate culture is driven by the so-called "salaryman".

00:17.798 --> 00:20.554
The salaryman is defined by his loyalty to his company...

00:20.661 --> 00:24.469
...and expected to spend his entire career working for the same firm.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.252
The nation's work ethic dates back...

00:26.333 --> 00:28.870
...to what's referred to as Japan's Economic Miracle,...

00:28.967 --> 00:32.707
...which was its dramatic economic growth beginning in the 1950s,...

00:32.814 --> 00:35.907
...which propelled it to become the world's second-largest economy.

00:36.057 --> 00:37.647
Inside Japan's corporations,...

00:37.743 --> 00:40.894
...the culture emphasizes the success of a company as a whole...

00:41.135 --> 00:43.753
...to be more important than any single individual,...

00:43.900 --> 00:46.095
...which might explain why one study found...

00:46.183 --> 00:50.560
...that 63% of Japanese felt guilty for taking paid leave.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.371
Japan's government has considered several initiatives...

00:53.455 --> 00:55.962
...to curb the number of hours spent at the office,...

00:56.119 --> 00:59.713
...including making it mandatory to take at least five vacation days a year...

00:59.851 --> 01:04.422
...and requiring a rest period between the end of one day and the start of another.
