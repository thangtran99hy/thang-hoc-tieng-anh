00:00.260 --> 00:01.631
Summertime is here...

00:01.791 --> 00:05.323
...and it might have you longing for the fresh, crisp air of the mountains.

00:05.493 --> 00:07.056
Well, before you head for the hills,...

00:07.181 --> 00:09.057
...here are some packing tips for your flight.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.850
If you're planning a quick day trip,...

00:10.993 --> 00:14.665
...it might not be a bad idea to pack some sunscreen and bug spray.

00:14.900 --> 00:20.511
These liquids must be less than 3.4 ounces and fit inside your one quart size bag per person.

00:20.665 --> 00:23.183
Now, if you're planning on staying a little longer and camping,...

00:23.452 --> 00:26.179
...essentials such as a tent, sleeping bags,...

00:26.365 --> 00:30.116
...flashlights, batteries cooking ware, utensils and matches...

00:30.371 --> 00:32.624
...are all allowed through the security checkpoint.

00:32.869 --> 00:35.374
Trekking poles or hiking sticks of any kind...

00:35.476 --> 00:37.582
...are not allowed through the security checkpoint...

00:37.781 --> 00:39.794
...and must be placed in checked baggage.

00:39.963 --> 00:43.521
Other items you may wish to pack may include a camping stove and fuel.

00:43.686 --> 00:47.093
Now, while the stove is allowed both through the checkpoint and in checked bags,...

00:47.233 --> 00:50.362
...the fuel is prohibited from being carried on or checked,...

00:50.548 --> 00:52.754
...so you should plan on picking that up at your destination.

00:52.945 --> 00:56.417
Flares, fireworks and bear spray are also prohibited...

00:56.517 --> 00:58.970
...in both checked and carry-on bags.
