NFTs, known as NFTies by insiders,...

00:02.903 --> 00:04.364
...are a type of digital asset.

00:04.536 --> 00:07.012
Ownership of these tokens is recorded on a blockchain,...

00:07.322 --> 00:09.970
...a digital ledger using similar technology to the networks...

00:10.055 --> 00:12.427
...that underpin Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

00:12.642 --> 00:15.893
But unlike currencies, where every token is of equal value...

00:16.035 --> 00:19.070
...and could be sold for any other, NFTs have unique qualities,...

00:19.150 --> 00:22.017
...which stop them from being interchangeable or fungible.

00:22.285 --> 00:22.846
You can think of them...

00:22.930 --> 00:26.428
...as the crypto alternative to rare Pokemon or baseball cards.

00:26.741 --> 00:28.349
And just like the traditional art market,...

00:28.475 --> 00:31.549
...NFTs are often sold at auction; prospective buyers...

00:31.631 --> 00:33.972
...bidding against each other until a price is reached.

00:34.313 --> 00:37.414
The rise of the Internet meant that images, videos and songs...

00:37.501 --> 00:40.421
...could be reproduced and distributed infinitely online,...

00:40.598 --> 00:43.527
...often without any royalties being paid to their creators,...

00:43.837 --> 00:47.591
...and even tech giants such as YouTube and Spotify have faced criticism...

00:47.706 --> 00:50.291
...for not compensating artists sufficiently for their work.

00:50.528 --> 00:53.813
Proponents of NFT say they address this problem by allowing ownership...

00:53.905 --> 00:55.424
...to be recorded on the blockchain,...

00:55.603 --> 00:58.065
...preventing unlimited reproduction or piracy,...

00:58.267 --> 01:00.642
...enabling creators to reap the financial rewards.

01:01.859 --> 01:06.379
Rock band Kings of Leon sold NFTs over two weeks in March 2021,...

01:06.467 --> 01:09.845
...which gave buyers access to a deluxe form of their album for $50,...

01:09.917 --> 01:12.562
...whilst also auctioning off an even more exclusive version...

01:12.667 --> 01:14.339
...limited to just 18 copies.

01:14.704 --> 01:18.433
In the same month, the NFT of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's first tweet...

01:18.529 --> 01:21.539
...sold for nearly $3 million to Sina Estavi,...

01:21.671 --> 01:23.455
...a Malaysia-based crypto entrepreneur.

01:23.830 --> 01:26.598
Meanwhile, art dealers are also getting on the action,...

01:26.759 --> 01:28.663
...with auction house Christie's running an auction...

01:28.793 --> 01:30.715
...for a virtual work from the artist Beeple,...

01:30.797 --> 01:33.561
...which eventually sold for 70 million dollars.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.613
But NFTs aren't a totally new phenomenon.

01:36.831 --> 01:40.335
CryptoKitties, a virtual pet game based on the blockchain Ethereum,...

01:40.493 --> 01:42.171
...was so popular in 2017...

01:42.269 --> 01:44.809
...that they clogged up the network of the cryptocurrency Ether.

01:45.009 --> 01:49.166
To date, these colorful online cats have generated sales over 40 million dollars.
