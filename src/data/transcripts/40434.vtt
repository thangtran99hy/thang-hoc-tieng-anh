00:00.050 --> 00:03.707
We begin with that deadly heat across the U.S. and Europe.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.939
Northwestern parts of Europe are seeing some relief today...

00:07.022 --> 00:09.181
...as the high temperatures shift east.

00:09.633 --> 00:15.101
Much of the Iberian peninsula, including Italy, Germany, Austria, even Sweden,...

00:15.316 --> 00:18.415
...are dealing with oppressively hot weather again today.

00:18.926 --> 00:21.183
Record high temperatures in the UK Tuesday...

00:21.269 --> 00:24.650
...caused train tracks to bend and roads to buckle.

00:25.009 --> 00:27.543
Rare wildfires broke out in and around London.

00:27.621 --> 00:31.435
The city logged its hottest day since records began.

00:31.673 --> 00:35.016
The hot weather is fueling out of control wildfires...

00:35.100 --> 00:36.492
...in other parts of Europe as well.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.538
Thousands of people evacuated homes in several countries.

00:39.931 --> 00:46.112
The heat has killed at least seventeen-hundred people in Spain and Portugal alone.

00:46.581 --> 00:50.783
CBS News foreign correspondent Elaine Cobbe joins us from Paris with more on this.

00:51.169 --> 00:55.050
Hi, Elaine. So the extreme heat is causing a lot of damage around Europe,...

00:55.143 --> 01:00.078
...whether it be to infrastructure, wildfires, or most upsettingly, the human toll.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.638
So, how are leaders responding to what's happening,...

01:02.716 --> 01:06.823
...and could we see nations move faster to adjust to climate change?

01:09.995 --> 01:10.950
It’s a tough one.

01:11.379 --> 01:15.600
President Emmanuel Macron is in the southwest today to meet the firefighters...

01:15.767 --> 01:21.087
...who’ve been battling the blazes that have been burning there for more than a week,...

01:21.900 --> 01:24.991
...fire chiefs there today saying for the first time,...

01:25.171 --> 01:28.717
...the lower temperatures and some dropped winds...

01:28.808 --> 01:33.437
...making it easier for them to take more control of the fires.
