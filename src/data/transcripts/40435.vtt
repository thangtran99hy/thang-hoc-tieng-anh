Public health officials here in New York City...

00:02.316 --> 00:06.275
…have said that now they will be focusing on getting the monkeypox vaccine...

00:06.450 --> 00:09.657
...to those people who have not received the first dose.

00:09.883 --> 00:14.025
And, of course, this puts into question if this is going to put at risk...

00:14.263 --> 00:16.705
…those who have already received the first dose.

00:17.299 --> 00:18.576
Complete chaos.

00:18.901 --> 00:23.762
That's what New Yorkers are calling the process to get monkeypox vaccines in the city.

00:24.252 --> 00:26.297
When I went to go get the shot, they said to me,...

00:26.368 --> 00:29.306
"Well, we're not really, we're not scheduling shots for the second dose...

00:29.381 --> 00:30.783
…because we don't know if we're gonna get them."

00:31.367 --> 00:34.410
Albert Lewitin, a New York media executive,...

00:34.530 --> 00:37.155
...is one of a handful to get the first shot...

00:37.335 --> 00:41.295
...and, like others, is uncertain he will get the second one.

00:43.136 --> 00:47.455
That doesn't mean we don't agree that a two shot dose is ideal,...

00:47.633 --> 00:50.302
…but we are in an environment of increasing cases,...

00:50.404 --> 00:53.601
…extreme demand, and extremely constrained supply.

00:53.767 --> 00:58.095
We do believe one shot does confer significant protection...

00:58.230 --> 01:00.752
…if not as much as two shots.
