00:00.008 --> 00:03.543
It started offering something very different: streaming content.

00:03.918 --> 00:06.011
The model was wildly successful.

00:06.154 --> 00:07.558
Netflix was a phenomenon.

00:07.767 --> 00:08.565
TV was dead.

00:08.797 --> 00:10.588
It was all about subscriptions.

00:10.877 --> 00:11.960
Here in Silicon Valley,...

00:12.055 --> 00:16.067
...Netflix has just released its new audience figures for the last quarter,...

00:16.312 --> 00:18.096
...and they're not especially good.

00:18.207 --> 00:21.147
They lost a million subscribers in the last three months.

00:21.415 --> 00:22.565
So what's gone wrong?

00:22.898 --> 00:25.212
For one, there is simply loads of competition.

00:25.357 --> 00:29.919
Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Apple TV, to name but a few...

00:30.319 --> 00:33.381
...and that competition has created a brutal spending war.

00:33.615 --> 00:35.499
The top eight streamers are predicted to spend...

00:35.702 --> 00:38.565
...more than 100 billion dollars on content this year.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.057
Netflix has come up with some monster hits in recent times.

00:42.345 --> 00:43.919
Think Squid Games, The Crown...

00:44.277 --> 00:47.929
...and Netflix productions were nominated for 27 Oscars this year.

00:48.055 --> 00:50.432
The company is still making good content,...

00:50.761 --> 00:53.510
...but the cost of living crisis has led to belt-tightening,...

00:53.615 --> 00:56.608
...with families across the world looking at streaming services...

00:56.863 --> 00:57.941
...as a potential saving.

00:58.222 --> 01:00.983
Many other households don't have a Netflix account at all,...

01:01.277 --> 01:03.254
...but share the login of friends or family.

01:03.605 --> 01:07.420
One study found that Netflix was losing 25 billion dollars a year...

01:07.757 --> 01:10.559
...from people watching Netflix on someone else's account.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.689
But Netflix has known about this problem for years...

01:13.847 --> 01:16.112
...and hasn't been able to stop it from happening.

01:16.343 --> 01:20.617
Instead, Netflix is now looking at adverts as a potential solution.
