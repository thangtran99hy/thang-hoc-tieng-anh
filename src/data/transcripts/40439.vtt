Amid high inflation and rising housing costs,...

00:03.645 --> 00:06.216
…it's not just young people looking for roommates.

00:06.472 --> 00:10.957
Some Americans in their sixties and seventies are turning to home sharing.

00:11.381 --> 00:14.389
Our economics correspondent, Paul Solman, has the story...

00:14.595 --> 00:20.060
…about a growing number of baby boomers who are considering becoming "boommates."

00:21.169 --> 00:23.327
Going to get some sunflower seeds.

00:24.272 --> 00:25.671
There.

00:26.303 --> 00:30.287
For years, Becky Miller, age 72, had only one companion.

00:30.429 --> 00:31.706
There you go.

00:31.953 --> 00:35.020
Maxi, a green cheeked conure.

00:35.299 --> 00:37.466
That's Mama's Maxi bird.

00:37.763 --> 00:39.342
But Maxi doesn't pay rent.

00:39.595 --> 00:43.244
And Miller, a retired receptionist, was having trouble making ends meet.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.427
I'm single, so I wasn't able to put a lot into my IRA.

00:48.863 --> 00:50.403
So, I depleted it.

00:50.591 --> 00:56.255
My mortgage and my HOA fees were over half of my income,...

00:56.531 --> 01:01.445
...so I decided, for financial reasons, to get a roommate.

01:02.141 --> 01:07.441
64 year old divorcee, Marlene Mears, moved into Miller's Longman, Colorado home...

01:07.567 --> 01:08.577
…a year and a half ago.

01:08.947 --> 01:10.838
I like saving money.

01:10.925 --> 01:16.414
I like having another person to talk to, to have a relationship with.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.637
It's nice to have some companionship when you're at home.
