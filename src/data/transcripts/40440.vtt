I love boba, and I actually went to the Flushing location and the Brooklyn location,...

00:05.628 --> 00:10.036
...and I'm really happy to be in the Chinatown location to learn how to make this.

00:12.399 --> 00:13.739
So, here, first part.

00:15.185 --> 00:18.945
We're gonna do something, which is secret; I'll see you in a second.

00:19.452 --> 00:22.280
The first step to making a perfect cup of Tiger Sugar...

00:22.370 --> 00:25.656
...is to coat the cup in their signature brown sugar syrup,...

00:25.869 --> 00:28.627
...but the exact method is a company secret.

00:29.285 --> 00:31.087
It was not as easy as it looks, so...

00:31.739 --> 00:34.380
All right, next part, we are going to put in the tapioca.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.734
What is the difference between the boba and the pearl?

00:37.843 --> 00:41.439
This is the most question people ask, the customers ask.

00:41.617 --> 00:45.520
The boba, our size is a bigger one, and the pearl is the mini one.

00:45.731 --> 00:47.388
So then, when they are added together,...

00:47.484 --> 00:51.734
...it will be a very amazing, chewy texture when you're drinking.

00:52.223 --> 00:53.519
Adding some ice.

00:55.257 --> 00:57.047
We're gonna fill it up to the top, right?

00:57.115 --> 00:57.497
Yes.

00:57.889 --> 01:03.653
Next, we're gonna put our organic whole milk, then, we're gonna seal it.

01:07.605 --> 01:08.768
It's automatic!

01:10.482 --> 01:12.197
But look at that.

01:13.013 --> 01:13.971
Wow, it's nice.

01:14.213 --> 01:14.883
It's nice?

01:15.276 --> 01:17.167
I think you're just being really nice to me.

01:19.233 --> 01:22.087
These look like, more like tiger paws.

01:22.375 --> 01:26.949
When done by one of the pros, this whole process takes only 10 seconds,...

01:27.043 --> 01:30.418
...from ordering to receiving a cup of boba in your hands.
