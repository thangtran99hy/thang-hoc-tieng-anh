00:00.501 --> 00:01.111
It's well-known...

00:01.189 --> 00:04.927
...that some gestures mean different things in different parts of the world.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.238
In some places such as Britain, this means everything is okay,...

00:09.375 --> 00:13.443
...while in Brazil and other places, it's considered obscene,...

00:13.668 --> 00:17.680
...and in still other places such as Japan, it means money.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.378
In Italy, they might make this sign to emphasize a point,...

00:22.530 --> 00:25.419
...while in Jordan, it can mean wait a second.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.094
Certain things often have gestures for them.

00:29.349 --> 00:33.140
For instance, in most places where drinking alcohol is popular,...

00:33.351 --> 00:35.958
...there's a sign for drinking or getting drunk.

00:36.346 --> 00:38.183
In the U.S., it's this...

00:39.405 --> 00:42.764
...while in France, they grab and twist their nose,...

00:43.233 --> 00:45.475
...and in Russia, they flick their throat.

00:46.859 --> 00:50.112
On the other hand, some places have more or less unique gestures.

00:50.448 --> 00:53.643
In Russia, to say you're making things too complicated,...

00:53.900 --> 00:57.622
...you scratch your ear by going around the back of your head.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.559
Among the most common and probably oldest gestures...

01:02.755 --> 01:06.019
...are nodding for yes and shaking the head for no.

01:06.626 --> 01:08.577
But even this isn't universal.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.121
Bulgarians are famous for shaking their head to mean yes...

01:13.364 --> 01:16.498
...and nodding with a click of the tongue to mean no.

01:17.332 --> 01:20.343
And in South Asia, they have a third option,...

01:20.567 --> 01:23.613
...which involves tilting the head from side to side.

01:23.945 --> 01:26.517
It's used to acknowledge the person speaking to you,...

01:26.751 --> 01:31.947
...although in some contexts, it can also mean approval or even uncertainty.
