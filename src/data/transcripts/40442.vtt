For more than 100 years, this picture has been holding a secret.

00:04.871 --> 00:07.458
On the back of Van Gogh's "Head of a Peasant Woman"...

00:07.695 --> 00:10.609
...is a previously unseen work by the artist.

00:11.381 --> 00:12.781
The ghostly image was revealed...

00:12.844 --> 00:15.971
...as experts carried out an x-ray on the painting.

00:16.421 --> 00:18.109
Oh, it was a complete shock,...

00:18.171 --> 00:22.496
...and I have to say, pretty much instant recognition...

00:22.871 --> 00:24.641
...and we thought, my goodness, there he is.

00:24.772 --> 00:31.485
We have his hat and his beard, signature neckerchief around his neck...

00:31.568 --> 00:35.360
...and it just struck us immediately that it was a self-portrait.

00:35.763 --> 00:39.858
As a poor artist, Van Gogh used both sides of the canvas to save money,...

00:40.209 --> 00:43.533
...but the self-portrait side is covered in cardboard and glue.

00:43.988 --> 00:48.003
Experts hope they can safely remove the material from this valuable piece.
