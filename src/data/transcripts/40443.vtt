Imagine having Alzheimer's disease or having a hard time seeing and hearing.

00:05.432 --> 00:07.144
These age-related health challenges...

00:07.228 --> 00:10.899
...can now be experienced through virtual reality or VR.

00:11.222 --> 00:15.169
Carrie Shaw founded Embodied Labs, a company that immerses a user...

00:15.236 --> 00:18.727
...into the world of the elderly to better understand their reality.

00:18.901 --> 00:21.228
The experiences include hearing the confusion...

00:21.300 --> 00:23.339
...related to memory loss from Alzheimer's...

00:23.553 --> 00:25.131
What was I looking for?

00:25.590 --> 00:26.811
...to visual impairment.

00:27.084 --> 00:29.371
Shaw's mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease.

00:29.653 --> 00:31.787
She realized even professional caregivers...

00:31.917 --> 00:34.382
...found it challenging interacting with her mother.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.461
The company offers the software and hardware needed for the VR experience...

00:38.685 --> 00:40.541
...to help users develop empathy.

00:40.663 --> 00:44.031
Jamie Hannans uses Embodied Labs to train nursing students.

00:44.259 --> 00:49.252
She says this VR experience with macular degeneration opened her eyes.

00:49.378 --> 00:53.149
For now, Embodied Labs only sells to services for the aging...

00:53.230 --> 00:54.205
...because Shaw says...

00:54.315 --> 00:58.265
...it's important that VR is paired with a guided discussion and reflection...

00:58.368 --> 01:00.514
...to process what the users experienced...

01:00.776 --> 01:03.888
...so they know how to put into action what they've learned.
