There are a lot of things here.

00:14.245 --> 00:17.231
There's ten different rooms, but within each room and zone,...

00:17.470 --> 00:18.985
...there are multiple different areas.

00:19.155 --> 00:20.766
You've got your dream house.

00:21.084 --> 00:23.450
Within the dream house, there's three separate sections:...

00:24.104 --> 00:27.237
...Barbie's living room, her office and closet and her kitchen.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.319
She's got her deck and pool.

00:29.609 --> 00:31.877
She's got the camper van as well as Central Park,...

00:32.335 --> 00:35.325
...the Barbie Interstellar Airways, Barbie laboratories,...

00:35.425 --> 00:36.729
...the music production studio,...

00:36.925 --> 00:39.450
...the fashion runway, the interior design studio.

00:39.794 --> 00:40.997
The list goes on and on.

00:41.603 --> 00:42.268
I couldn't stop.

00:42.389 --> 00:43.475
We'd be here all day.

00:43.613 --> 00:45.811
They have different things from every era.

00:45.912 --> 00:48.661
So every time you see something from your era as a child,...

00:48.742 --> 00:51.097
...it brings you back to that time that you were there...

00:51.459 --> 00:54.529
...and then all the new bright things are just, it's fantastic.
