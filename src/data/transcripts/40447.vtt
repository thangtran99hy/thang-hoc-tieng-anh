London is the best city in the world.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.028
Well, I know what you're gonna say.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.785
I think that London is a beautiful place.

00:11.900 --> 00:17.235
And I love it here, but there's also other beautiful places in the world.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.328
I'm sitting right here.

00:20.139 --> 00:20.532
Do you know what?

00:20.601 --> 00:21.934
I'm actually gonna go with "Agree"...

00:22.011 --> 00:24.346
...because I haven't been to all the cities in the world.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.793
And, you know, lots of places have assets that London doesn't have.

00:27.885 --> 00:29.930
Like, you go to Barcelona, you have the beach, you know.

00:30.009 --> 00:30.337
Yeah.

00:31.807 --> 00:32.576
No, I love London.

00:32.647 --> 00:34.383
London is my home, I've grown up here.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.539
Whenever I come back, it feels like I'm a part of the city.

00:38.856 --> 00:39.583
It's a great city.

00:39.660 --> 00:40.929
Great food, lovely people.

00:41.154 --> 00:42.491
Can you tell that he's English?
