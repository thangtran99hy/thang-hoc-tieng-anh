00:02.497 --> 00:03.979
Miss Monroe, it's time.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.043
How did you get your start?

00:20.865 --> 00:21.778
What start?

00:22.010 --> 00:22.925
In movies.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.470
I guess I was discovered.

00:41.271 --> 00:43.339
I know you're supposed to get used to it,...

00:48.113 --> 00:49.302
...but I just can't.

00:53.423 --> 00:59.812
I've played Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe.

01:04.429 --> 01:07.444
I can't face doing another scene with Marilyn Monroe.

01:11.499 --> 01:13.149
Marilyn doesn't exist.

01:17.253 --> 01:20.388
When I come out of my dressing room, I'm Norma Jean.

01:23.513 --> 01:25.761
I'm still her when the camera is rolling.

01:42.813 --> 01:45.183
Marilyn Monroe only exists on the screen.
