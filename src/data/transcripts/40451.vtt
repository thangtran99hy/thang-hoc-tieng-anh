00:00.175 --> 00:02.309
"Pan," the Greek word for "all."

00:02.653 --> 00:04.701
"Theos," Greek for "gods."

00:05.187 --> 00:07.066
"Pantheon," "all the gods."

00:07.879 --> 00:11.467
No one knows why this name was given to the oldest in use building in the world,...

00:11.643 --> 00:13.293
...but maybe it's apt in one respect.

00:13.831 --> 00:17.945
The Pantheon in Rome could be the closest that human creation has come to immortality.

00:18.817 --> 00:21.735
In 2019, nine million people visited the Pantheon.

00:22.093 --> 00:24.007
It was the most visited site in Italy.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.775
The building of today isn't the first Pantheon here.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.621
There were two before it and both burned down,...

00:33.705 --> 00:36.103
...giving rise to the idea that the building was cursed.

00:37.345 --> 00:41.551
The one that stands now was completed circa 125 AD by Emperor Hadrian,...

00:41.827 --> 00:44.128
...who also made this wall, Hadrian's Wall.

00:44.821 --> 00:47.819
But what the Pantheon was used for is far from certain.

00:48.337 --> 00:51.487
One theory suggests it was where the emperor communed with his fellow gods,...

00:51.622 --> 00:53.311
...a coffeehouse for the immortals.

00:53.939 --> 00:55.415
Another claims it was a holy site...

00:55.567 --> 00:59.425
...where Rome's founder, Romulus, ascended to heaven to become the god Quirinus.

01:00.529 --> 01:03.374
This is Pantheon's dome, crowned at its apex...

01:03.477 --> 01:06.382
...with a 30-foot oculus, an opening to the heavens.

01:07.922 --> 01:11.561
The dome is still the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world.

01:11.874 --> 01:15.521
It is also a perfect hemisphere, 142 feet across.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.639
So masterful was the dome that in medieval times,...

01:18.717 --> 01:20.144
...it was considered the work of the devil...

01:20.536 --> 01:22.551
...because no mortal could have created it.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.396
Michelangelo called it angelic, not human.
