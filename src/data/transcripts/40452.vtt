Welcome to English in a minute.

00:06.643 --> 00:08.705
This is a fence.

00:09.085 --> 00:12.404
Fences are used to separate two areas.

00:12.803 --> 00:15.065
But what could this idiom mean?

00:16.128 --> 00:17.464
On the fence.

00:18.265 --> 00:20.343
Okay Anna, have you decided?

00:20.540 --> 00:21.367
Yes.

00:22.278 --> 00:23.184
No.

00:24.316 --> 00:28.545
For two days, I have thought about the pros and the cons,...

00:29.749 --> 00:31.963
...but I am still on the fence.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.267
Well, you can't sit on the fence much longer.

00:34.647 --> 00:35.888
I need a decision.

00:36.505 --> 00:38.859
Do you want chocolate cake or vanilla?

00:38.998 --> 00:39.703
I don't know.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.898
Someone who is on the fence...

00:43.119 --> 00:47.272
...has not made a decision or picked a side in some issue.

00:47.737 --> 00:51.417
To sit on the fence means to be undecided.

00:52.049 --> 00:55.487
Someone who always has a hard time making decisions...

00:55.820 --> 00:58.295
...can even be called a fence-sitter.
