Welcome to English in a minute.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.927
The beach is such a fun place.

00:09.111 --> 00:12.040
You can swim in the ocean and dig in the sand.

00:12.562 --> 00:14.924
You can even bury things in the sand.

00:15.590 --> 00:18.750
But I wouldn't recommend doing this.

00:20.401 --> 00:22.135
Bury your head in the sand.

00:24.134 --> 00:28.180
Jonathan, what are you doing about the plankton problem?

00:28.864 --> 00:29.736
Plankton problem?

00:30.608 --> 00:32.628
I don't know about any plankton problem.

00:32.957 --> 00:36.487
I feel like the whole world is burying its head in the sand...

00:36.563 --> 00:37.903
...about the plankton problem.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.603
I'm not avoiding the plankton problem.

00:41.059 --> 00:43.139
I know nothing about the plankton problem.

00:45.612 --> 00:47.835
To bury your head in the sand...

00:47.953 --> 00:51.756
...means to hide from a problem or unpleasant reality.

00:52.561 --> 00:53.759
But at some point,...

00:53.995 --> 00:57.967
...you will have to face whatever situation you are avoiding.
