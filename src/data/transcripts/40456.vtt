When we know what we're good at,...

00:01.783 --> 00:04.832
...and use those skills regularly, our lives improve.

00:05.254 --> 00:09.557
We feel more confident about ourselves, and that confidence makes us happier.

00:10.072 --> 00:14.338
We also have a chance to share these skills with others by doing work of value,...

00:14.651 --> 00:17.063
...and earn money doing the things we love most.

00:17.738 --> 00:21.115
One way to find out what you're good at is by thinking about your talents.

00:21.535 --> 00:23.707
What are the things that come naturally to you?

00:24.119 --> 00:27.715
Maybe it's writing, or cooking, or creating something new.

00:28.103 --> 00:30.648
Perhaps it's working with children or animals,...

00:30.880 --> 00:32.781
...or maybe it's being a math whiz.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.341
Whatever your strengths are,...

00:34.539 --> 00:36.117
...think about how often you use them...

00:36.407 --> 00:38.587
...and whether there are ways you can use them even more.
