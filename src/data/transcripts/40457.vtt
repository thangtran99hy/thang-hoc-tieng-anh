00:00.249 --> 00:02.019
In order to live a more fulfilling life,...

00:02.318 --> 00:04.258
...you must first know what your values are.

00:04.856 --> 00:07.667
Values are those things that are most important to you in life...

00:08.033 --> 00:09.855
...and which guide the choices that you make.

00:10.479 --> 00:12.645
When we compare our actions with our values,...

00:12.900 --> 00:15.195
...we gain insight into whether or not our actions...

00:15.285 --> 00:16.979
...are aligned with who we want to be.

00:17.725 --> 00:19.886
If you find yourself doing things that don't match up...

00:19.979 --> 00:22.117
...with what really matters to you most in life,...

00:22.545 --> 00:24.170
...then something needs to change.
