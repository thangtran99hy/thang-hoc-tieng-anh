00:01.486 --> 00:06.547
Why didn't you apologize to Chris in your acceptance speech?

00:09.749 --> 00:11.507
I was fogged out by that point.

00:15.171 --> 00:16.083
It's all fuzzy.

00:16.368 --> 00:18.041
I've reached out to Chris...

00:18.595 --> 00:25.589
...and the message that came back is that he's not ready to talk,...

00:25.971 --> 00:29.696
...and when he is, he will reach out.

00:32.565 --> 00:41.941
So, I will say to you, Chris, I apologize to you.

00:42.883 --> 00:46.951
My behavior was unacceptable,...

00:47.859 --> 00:50.691
....and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk.

00:55.234 --> 00:58.407
I want to apologize to Chris's mother.

00:58.843 --> 01:01.191
I saw an interview that Chris's mother did,...

01:02.975 --> 01:04.228
...and you know and that was one of the things...

01:04.313 --> 01:06.622
...about that moment I just didn't realize.

01:07.551 --> 01:12.698
I wasn't thinking but how many people got hurt in that moment?

01:13.579 --> 01:16.455
So, I want to apologize to Chris's mother.

01:16.759 --> 01:20.552
I want to apologize to Chris's family.

01:21.287 --> 01:26.739
I spent the last three months replaying...

01:27.105 --> 01:30.727
...and understanding the nuances...

01:30.841 --> 01:36.795
...and the complexities of what happened in that moment.

01:38.437 --> 01:41.973
And I'm not going to try to unpack all of that right now,...

01:42.343 --> 01:47.729
...but I can say to all of you, there is no part of me...

01:48.382 --> 01:55.169
...that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment.

01:56.112 --> 02:00.819
There's no part of me that thinks that's the optimal way...

02:01.353 --> 02:08.157
...to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults.
