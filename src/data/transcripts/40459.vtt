Do you know where Brian is?

00:03.041 --> 00:04.562
I saw him leaving the building.

00:04.707 --> 00:05.032
Why?

00:05.769 --> 00:09.025
I need to ask him about the details of his project with Dana.

00:09.654 --> 00:12.576
I called him several times, but he didn't answer.

00:13.423 --> 00:16.945
He said he was going to meet our boss at the nearby coffee shop.

00:17.462 --> 00:18.683
They should be back soon.

00:19.299 --> 00:19.907
Will they?

00:20.247 --> 00:22.510
But I can't wait until Brian comes back.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.539
Why don't you call Dana then?

00:25.429 --> 00:27.743
I saw her at her workstation a few minutes ago.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.063
She must be there.

00:29.531 --> 00:30.481
Thanks, Bobby.
