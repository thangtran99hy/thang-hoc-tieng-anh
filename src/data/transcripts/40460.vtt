Whether it's searching for a new restaurant or a vacation getaway,...

00:02.903 --> 00:05.183
…the first place many of us go is Google.

00:05.267 --> 00:07.548
But internal research shared by Google...

00:07.694 --> 00:11.127
…found that nearly half of Gen Z-ers actually go to social media platforms.

00:11.201 --> 00:12.783
So, we're talking Instagram or TikTok.

00:12.995 --> 00:14.229
And that's to get their information.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.205
Super fascinating.

00:15.276 --> 00:19.818
The ages of those surveyed ranges from eighteen to twenty-four, according to TechCrunch.

00:20.149 --> 00:23.611
So, what exactly is behind this shift in search habits?

00:23.965 --> 00:28.173
NBC Youth and Internet Culture Reporter, Kalhan Rosenblatt, has the answers.

00:28.256 --> 00:28.844
She always does.

00:28.915 --> 00:29.467
She joins us now.

00:29.536 --> 00:30.051
Hey, Kalhan.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.168
You know, I remember a few years ago we were talking about...

00:32.237 --> 00:35.133
…how YouTube was a huge search engine for younger people,...

00:35.204 --> 00:37.226
…and now, it's these social media platforms.

00:37.718 --> 00:39.933
Is it because people are looking for videos or photos,...

00:40.019 --> 00:41.499
…rather than text and information...

00:41.581 --> 00:43.603
…like the kinds of things they may get on a Google search?

00:44.877 --> 00:45.824
Yeah, Vicky, you nailed it.

00:45.934 --> 00:49.323
It is because of the visual aspect of a platform like Tiktok.

00:49.633 --> 00:53.081
These young people want to see when they're checking out a makeup brand,...

00:53.149 --> 00:55.155
…a skincare line, a place to go on vacation,...

00:55.346 --> 00:56.434
…they want to see what it looks like.

00:56.513 --> 00:58.153
What does a product look like on someone's skin?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.515
What does the spot look like where I might go?

01:00.797 --> 01:05.292
What menu items are at this restaurant that I might attend or patronize?

01:05.678 --> 01:09.565
It's all about the visuals of an app like TikTok or Instagram.

01:09.789 --> 01:13.415
Now, the young people I spoke with said that they tend to lean more towards TikTok...

01:13.533 --> 01:16.209
…because TikTok has a more robust search feature.

01:16.399 --> 01:17.880
It has an autofill feature.

01:18.391 --> 01:22.347
But they also use platforms like Instagram and Pinterest even,...

01:22.503 --> 01:25.254
…when they're looking to design an outfit, come up with an aesthetic,...

01:25.331 --> 01:26.773
…figure out how they want to decorate their room.

01:26.934 --> 01:30.673
So, it's really all about that visual nature of these social media platforms...

01:30.751 --> 01:32.586
…that's drawing in a younger audience.
