Well, how did a major crypto lender go from managing billions in assets...

00:04.180 --> 00:06.649
...to filing for bankruptcy in just a matter of months?

00:06.920 --> 00:10.295
Celsius made headlines last month after freezing customer accounts...

00:10.375 --> 00:13.903
...and leaving them in the dark about when or if they would get their money back.

00:14.359 --> 00:17.650
Now for the first time, two former Celsius leaders are revealing...

00:17.725 --> 00:19.947
...what they say led to the company's downfall.

00:20.372 --> 00:21.880
Here's CNBC's Kate Rooney.

00:23.671 --> 00:27.786
Timothy Cradle's career had been about making sure companies follow the rules.

00:28.149 --> 00:33.568
So, he says he was alarmed by conversations at a Celsius corporate event in late 2019.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.871
There was a bit of an odd thing that came up at one of our Christmas parties.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.609
Cradle, the former Director of Financial Crimes Compliance,...

00:40.674 --> 00:45.066
...says top executives were talking about deliberate price movements in a CEL token.

00:45.456 --> 00:50.577
The cryptocurrency created and used by Celsius started to spike in early 2020.

00:50.773 --> 00:53.769
I don't know what better way to phrase it, but they were in the market.

00:53.843 --> 00:57.285
They were actively trading and increasing the price of the token.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.951
Based on those conversations,...

00:59.029 --> 01:03.337
...youâ€™re saying that management was manipulating the price of the Celsius token.

01:03.405 --> 01:06.407
They were absolutely trading the token to manipulate the price.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.693
This echoes claims in a lawsuit,...

01:08.786 --> 01:11.634
...alleging the company was actively using customer funds...

01:11.716 --> 01:14.517
...to manipulate crypto asset markets to their benefit.

01:14.893 --> 01:17.587
Market manipulation is one of the biggest issues in crypto,...

01:17.669 --> 01:21.466
...and it's one of multiple issues former employees are now speaking out about.
