00:01.679 --> 00:05.975
It is an expensive summer of travel stress at airports worldwide...

00:06.179 --> 00:10.211
...with airlines struggling with staffing shortages and schedule meltdowns.

00:10.495 --> 00:11.353
Now we're stranded.

00:11.538 --> 00:13.873
From Thursday to Monday, airlines in the U.S....

00:14.043 --> 00:16.663
...canceled more than 5400 flights.

00:16.791 --> 00:20.801
Makes me not want to travel at all, go on no airplanes.

00:20.919 --> 00:21.417
Nothing.

00:21.557 --> 00:23.587
New analysis from travel site Hopper says....

00:23.758 --> 00:27.813
...flight cancellations have jumped 34% in the last month.

00:28.189 --> 00:32.665
Domestic ticket prices are up too by 18% since 2019.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.690
Even still, passengers are packing planes.

00:35.906 --> 00:39.349
Last weekend, the TSA screened more people at airports nationwide...

00:39.619 --> 00:42.820
...than any weekend since the start of the pandemic.
