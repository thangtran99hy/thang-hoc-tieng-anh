Vietnam is known for having some of the world's most amazing cuisine,...

00:04.081 --> 00:06.700
...and today we are going on a cooking class tour to learn...

00:06.797 --> 00:08.328
...how to make some of it for ourselves.

00:08.826 --> 00:10.967
So the tour starts by meeting up with your group.

00:11.055 --> 00:12.341
Then you're going to head to a local market...

00:12.417 --> 00:14.579
...to pick up ingredients for the cooking class.

00:16.465 --> 00:19.125
Half the fun of a tour like this is coming to a market...

00:19.196 --> 00:21.141
...where you get to see the food from around the world...

00:21.260 --> 00:21.958
...that people are eating.

00:24.755 --> 00:25.645
Oh my gosh.

00:25.732 --> 00:26.446
We left the market.

00:26.523 --> 00:27.429
We have all of our ingredients,...

00:27.508 --> 00:29.993
...and a few steps away is the kitchen for our cooking class.

00:30.409 --> 00:32.526
Oh! This is so beautiful.

00:32.870 --> 00:33.797
Hello everybody.

00:33.943 --> 00:35.177
Welcome to Rose Kitchen.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.137
Our first dish, we're preparing a salad.

00:39.948 --> 00:41.325
You cook a variety of dishes,...

00:41.491 --> 00:43.652
...and they can accommodate dietary requirements.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.371
It's a small group of no more than ten people.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.166
Now we're preparing bun cha, which is an iconic Vietnamese dish.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.035
It's barbecue pork.

00:54.658 --> 00:55.565
Okay, let's eat.

00:56.246 --> 00:57.456
I'm going to try the salad.

00:57.731 --> 00:58.885
This is banana flower.

01:03.891 --> 01:04.567
So good.

01:06.296 --> 01:07.256
We did a good job.

01:09.341 --> 01:11.066
That's one of the best things I've ever eaten.

01:16.227 --> 01:17.514
I'm in absolute heaven.

01:18.086 --> 01:19.493
And it's a good thing I'm eating with chopsticks...

01:19.607 --> 01:20.762
...because it's slowing me down.

01:21.141 --> 01:24.025
This is probably one of the best meals I've ever had.
