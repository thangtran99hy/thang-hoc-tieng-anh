Here are some phrases you can use when saying "no."

00:05.677 --> 00:06.807
Nope, sorry.

00:08.745 --> 00:10.189
Maybe another time.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.955
That's not going to work for me.

00:15.639 --> 00:19.799
My body says yes, but my heart says no.

00:21.561 --> 00:24.558
Sounds fun, but I'm unavailable.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.535
I want to, but I'm unable to.

00:31.328 --> 00:33.980
Apologies, but I can't make it.

00:35.814 --> 00:37.512
It's not a good idea for me.

00:39.233 --> 00:41.810
I am not able to commit to that right now.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.049
I just don't have that to give right now.
