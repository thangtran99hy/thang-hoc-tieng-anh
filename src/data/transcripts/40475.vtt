Just like you need to eat, drink and sleep to be able to wake up strong,...

00:04.312 --> 00:06.643
...everything around us needs energy.

00:07.704 --> 00:10.267
We get energy from two types of sources:...

00:10.495 --> 00:12.571
...renewable and non-renewable.

00:13.385 --> 00:18.027
One of these renewable energy sources is wind energy, which comes from the wind,...

00:18.322 --> 00:22.689
...the natural resource you can find all over the planet and that is never-ending.

00:23.107 --> 00:25.897
So you may be wondering, where does wind come from?

00:26.365 --> 00:27.671
First, we need the sun.

00:27.900 --> 00:32.082
The same rays that make you tan in summer are used to heat up the planet.

00:32.604 --> 00:36.517
As the planet heats up, the air begins to be of different temperatures.

00:36.704 --> 00:40.013
Hot air tends to rise and cold air tends to drop.

00:40.334 --> 00:43.428
This movement of uneven air produces wind.

00:44.771 --> 00:45.957
So far, so good.

00:46.612 --> 00:47.636
Easy, right?

00:48.331 --> 00:49.574
Now, the question is,...

00:49.835 --> 00:53.819
...how can something we cannot capture with our hands generate energy?

00:54.461 --> 00:57.601
When it is windy, we use wind turbines,...

00:57.706 --> 01:02.139
...modern mills that transform the energy from the wind into electricity,...

01:02.416 --> 01:06.707
...which is what reaches our homes so all of our appliances and devices can work.

01:07.365 --> 01:10.360
Since the wind is a natural and never-ending resource,...

01:10.481 --> 01:13.777
...wind energy is a clean and sustainable source of energy.

01:13.979 --> 01:17.720
It reduces pollution as it doesn't produce any greenhouse gases,...

01:17.862 --> 01:22.235
...and therefore, it helps us care for the environment and get the planet smiling.

01:22.978 --> 01:26.441
To achieve all of this, we need at least one wind turbine.

01:27.054 --> 01:30.153
They are called wind turbines or wind generators,...

01:30.277 --> 01:33.529
...and you see them quite often when traveling on holiday by car.

01:34.423 --> 01:38.835
The wind moves the blades, and as they rotate, they produce electricity.

01:40.289 --> 01:41.276
Now you know it.

01:41.826 --> 01:45.997
When the wind moves these turbines, you can turn on the lights when you get home,...
