It was a little bit difficult to wrap your mind around it at first,...

00:02.997 --> 00:05.275
...like this fridge that's outside.

00:05.359 --> 00:06.107
How does that work?

00:06.205 --> 00:07.695
But it does, it works.

00:07.835 --> 00:09.726
My name is Viri from Mexico,...

00:09.811 --> 00:11.658
...Chattanooga for the past four years...

00:11.763 --> 00:14.381
...and I started the Chattanooga Community Fridge.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.768
It is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.011
And the way that it works...

00:19.105 --> 00:22.783
...is people come by and are able to get what they need from the fridge...

00:22.858 --> 00:24.225
...and drop off what you can.

00:24.318 --> 00:25.835
I'll clean it and stock it,...

00:25.939 --> 00:29.123
...but it's your fridge, it's my fridge, everybody's fridge.

00:29.251 --> 00:29.899
Thank you.

00:30.794 --> 00:33.111
I grew up with a lot of food insecurity at home,...

00:33.436 --> 00:36.383
...a lot of not knowing where we're going to get our next meal,...

00:36.495 --> 00:39.199
...so this project, it's really close to my heart.

00:39.313 --> 00:42.355
Access to food is a basic human right.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.280
There is enough for everybody.

00:44.766 --> 00:49.663
The fridge feeds a lot of people and builds a community of its own.

00:49.789 --> 00:53.888
I hope that this can empower other people to take care of one another.

00:54.021 --> 00:57.527
It's a really beautiful thing what a simple fridge can do.
