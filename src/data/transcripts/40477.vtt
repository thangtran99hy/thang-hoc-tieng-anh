00:00.345 --> 00:02.193
It's an important day for Colombia...

00:02.282 --> 00:05.506
...as the Latin American country's first ever left-wing president...

00:05.783 --> 00:07.799
...Gustavo Petro is inaugurated.

00:09.761 --> 00:11.295
From the early hours of Sunday,...

00:11.412 --> 00:13.079
...people began arriving in the capital...

00:13.191 --> 00:15.565
...from all regions of the country for the event.

00:15.885 --> 00:19.063
Today is a historic day for our beloved country, Colombia,...

00:19.287 --> 00:21.935
...because for the first time in 200 years,...

00:22.030 --> 00:25.917
...a ruler who was elected by the people, for the people, takes office.

00:25.994 --> 00:28.360
As a former senator and mayor of Bogota,...

00:28.811 --> 00:30.977
...he is promising a more inclusive government.

00:31.285 --> 00:34.706
He wants to address inequality, offer free education,...

00:34.963 --> 00:36.564
...improve the health care system,...

00:36.758 --> 00:40.508
...and to phase out Colombia's reliance on fossil fuel extraction.

00:40.712 --> 00:44.313
To pay for these ambitious measures, he's promising tax reforms.

00:45.439 --> 00:48.702
But Mr. Petro is also a former left-wing guerrilla leader,...

00:49.071 --> 00:52.312
...and as president, says he will fully implement a peace deal...

00:52.399 --> 00:55.079
...signed with the FARC rebel group in 2016,...

00:55.371 --> 00:56.416
...a deal that stalled...

00:56.477 --> 00:59.457
...under the administration of outgoing leader Ivan Duque.
