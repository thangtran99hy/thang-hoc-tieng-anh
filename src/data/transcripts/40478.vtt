00:01.422 --> 00:06.062
Japanese designer Issey Miyake has died at the age of 84.

00:06.678 --> 00:09.653
Famed for his iconic pleated styles of clothing,...

00:09.813 --> 00:13.314
...Miyake was also known for producing the signature black turtleneck...

00:13.465 --> 00:16.497
...of his friend and Apple founder Steve Jobs.

00:17.219 --> 00:21.761
He died on August 5th from liver cancer according to Kyodo News Agency.

00:22.977 --> 00:24.844
Miyake was born in Hiroshima...

00:25.111 --> 00:28.054
...and seven years old when the atomic bomb dropped on the city.

00:28.711 --> 00:31.646
His mother died three years later from radiation exposure.

00:32.124 --> 00:35.910
He was reluctant to speak about his experience until later in life.

00:36.281 --> 00:37.477
As part of a campaign...

00:37.566 --> 00:40.949
...to get then U.S. President Barack Obama to visit the city,...

00:41.170 --> 00:42.470
...he wrote in the New York Times...

00:42.543 --> 00:43.867
...that he did not want to be labeled...

00:43.941 --> 00:46.068
...as the designer who survived the bomb,...

00:46.416 --> 00:50.125
...but that he continued to see things no one should ever experience.

00:50.792 --> 00:54.094
While he originally wanted to be a dancer or athlete,...

00:54.377 --> 00:55.555
...his passion for design...

00:55.656 --> 00:58.502
...would come from reading his sister's fashion magazines.

00:59.145 --> 01:02.597
After studying graphic design at a Tokyo art university,...

01:02.905 --> 01:05.447
...he worked with famed fashion designers in Paris.

01:06.059 --> 01:10.664
He moved back to Tokyo in 1970 and founded the Miyake Design Studio.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.833
His pleated designs would come to life nearly two decades later.

01:15.436 --> 01:18.308
Miyake went on to create more than a dozen fashion lines...

01:18.455 --> 01:23.245
...before essentially retiring in 1997 to devote himself to research.
