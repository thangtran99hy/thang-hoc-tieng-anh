The Sunrise Seven is a group of chimps...

00:03.233 --> 00:09.319
...from a wildlife refuge in California that closed in 2019.

00:09.648 --> 00:12.417
We're really grateful to be able to say yes,...

00:12.535 --> 00:15.540
...we can bring them to our sanctuary in Florida.

00:15.823 --> 00:18.588
Save the Chimps is a nonprofit organization,...

00:18.819 --> 00:23.275
...one of the largest chimpanzee sanctuaries in the world.

00:23.619 --> 00:30.952
Bringing seven chimpanzees from California to Florida is not a small task.

00:31.271 --> 00:34.491
We knew that FedEx Cares help nonprofits,...

00:34.609 --> 00:39.706
...so we reached out and FedEx helped to transport the Sunrise Seven...

00:39.791 --> 00:42.678
...as part of their Delivering for Good initiative.

00:43.210 --> 00:49.233
The seven chimpanzees now have lifelong care at a loving home,...

00:49.431 --> 00:55.588
...giving them the space to roam in natural habitats with other chimpanzees.

00:55.857 --> 01:01.248
We can't wait to see who they are going to bond with, be best friends with.

01:01.510 --> 01:06.570
It's our moral responsibility to care for these vulnerable beings.

01:06.805 --> 01:10.947
They deserve a peaceful and safe retirement.
