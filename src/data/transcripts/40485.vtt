00:01.455 --> 00:04.466
Being attractive is its own sort of prison.

00:05.528 --> 00:07.650
What if we stopped offering thoughts and prayers...

00:08.567 --> 00:11.276
...and instead offer prayers and thoughts?

00:12.447 --> 00:18.200
For many years, we've watched TV, but now the TV watches us.

00:20.391 --> 00:22.820
You have my permission to love.

00:29.501 --> 00:31.009
My new motto for mental health:....

00:31.951 --> 00:35.583
"Real eyes realize real lies."

00:36.666 --> 00:37.925
Sit with that one for a minute.

00:38.786 --> 00:42.773
It's hard to believe that ten years ago was just ten years ago.

00:43.457 --> 00:45.871
So it's totally normal for a guy to be named Guy,...

00:46.558 --> 00:48.793
...but weird for a girl to be named Girl.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.857
For a freshwater creature, frogs are really cool.

00:58.835 --> 01:00.858
Did you know that if you're young,...

01:01.736 --> 01:04.456
...you haven't met most of the people who will attend your funeral?

01:07.515 --> 01:10.049
If you drop a single tea leaf in the ocean,...

01:10.779 --> 01:13.035
...the ocean becomes one very diluted tea.

01:14.092 --> 01:16.987
I mean, at this point, why are they even called phones?

01:17.335 --> 01:20.906
Did you know we spend all of our time watching the time...

01:21.900 --> 01:22.509
...most of the time?

01:22.632 --> 01:26.273
But what happens when we run out of time?
