In recent years, some of the world's biggest companies...

00:03.233 --> 00:06.257
...have discarded depth and detail to debrand.

00:06.748 --> 00:07.967
Burger King lost weight.

00:08.457 --> 00:10.427
Rolling Stone found a cleaner edge.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.850
VW shed its depth and shadow,...

00:13.349 --> 00:18.734
...as did Kia, Pfizer, Nissan, Durex, Intel, Toyota...

00:19.055 --> 00:21.009
...and a host of other major brands.

00:21.833 --> 00:25.836
Even the munchable hero Julius Pringle had a flattening make-under...

00:26.070 --> 00:31.575
...with shaved head, dyed mustache, dilated eyes and new pre-strung eyebrows.

00:32.099 --> 00:35.278
But what prompted this landslide of logo debranding?

00:35.801 --> 00:37.992
Several interlocking forces are at work,...

00:38.411 --> 00:42.115
...the most immediate of which is the pressure of mobile first design.

00:42.621 --> 00:45.485
Clients used to ask, "Can you make the logo bigger?"

00:45.803 --> 00:50.098
Now the trick is to shrink an entire identity into a tiny digital box.

00:50.423 --> 00:54.465
Such pixel pressure usually means returning to the 2D look of old.

00:54.977 --> 00:59.611
Of course, this 2D look was more or less the norm until computers took over...

00:59.819 --> 01:02.941
...and design inflation spiraled out of control.

01:03.683 --> 01:06.683
Anyone who has overfiltered an Instagram sunset...

01:06.857 --> 01:09.688
...knows the seductive lure of visual excess,...

01:10.025 --> 01:12.563
...and it's a seduction to which the pros are not immune.

01:13.194 --> 01:17.349
The ability to round corners, drop shadows, customize gradients...

01:17.489 --> 01:22.109
...and create complex lighting effects can easily overpower the creative brief...

01:22.261 --> 01:23.443
...and often does.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.429
So many recently brands represent a return to sobriety...

01:27.598 --> 01:30.922
...after a spasm of software-embedded intoxication.
