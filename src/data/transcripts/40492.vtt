In 1942, Albert Einstein was teaching at Oxford University.

00:04.559 --> 00:07.509
And one day, he just gave an exam of physics...

00:07.596 --> 00:09.598
...to his senior class of physics students.

00:09.987 --> 00:12.479
And he was walking on the campus with his assistant,...

00:12.840 --> 00:15.622
...and all of a sudden, the assistant looked at Albert Einstein and said,...

00:16.064 --> 00:19.883
..."Dr. Einstein, this exam which you just gave...

00:20.266 --> 00:22.120
...to the senior class of physics students,...

00:22.615 --> 00:25.503
...isn't that exactly the same exam you gave to...

00:25.601 --> 00:28.083
...exactly the same class one year ago?"

00:30.105 --> 00:32.604
"Yeah, yeah, it's exactly the same."

00:34.374 --> 00:37.003
"But Dr. Einstein, how could you possibly do that?" he said.

00:37.217 --> 00:39.940
"Well," said Einstein, "the answers have changed."
