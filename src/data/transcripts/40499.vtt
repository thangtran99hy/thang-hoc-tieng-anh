TSMC is the largest and most advanced chipmaker in the world...

00:04.658 --> 00:10.217
...supplying the biggest companies Apple, Nvidia, Intel, you name it.

00:10.881 --> 00:14.194
And it's so powerful that it doesn't compete with companies.

00:14.584 --> 00:16.350
It competes with governments.

00:17.025 --> 00:19.994
So how did they achieve this global monopoly?

00:20.801 --> 00:24.467
Back in the 80s, large American corporations like Intel...

00:24.746 --> 00:26.977
...used to make their own chips in-house.

00:27.512 --> 00:30.891
In those days, profits for the IT sector were booming...

00:31.119 --> 00:34.100
...and companies like Apple were becoming leading players.

00:34.719 --> 00:37.103
It was then that more and more companies...

00:37.189 --> 00:39.779
...started outsourcing their chip manufacturing.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.521
They decided to focus on aspects like the chip's design...

00:43.789 --> 00:46.216
...and then simply produce the chips elsewhere.

00:46.898 --> 00:50.401
That's because fabrication plants, also called fabs,...

00:50.703 --> 00:53.660
...are extremely expensive and hardly profitable.

00:54.081 --> 00:57.390
So while big tech moved their productions abroad,...

00:57.895 --> 01:00.093
...someone saw an opportunity there.

01:00.741 --> 01:04.077
Morris Chang, soon-to-be founder of TSMC,...

01:04.253 --> 01:06.830
...made a career for himself in the United States.

01:07.439 --> 01:08.767
Maybe you never heard of him,...

01:09.007 --> 01:11.622
...but he changed your life more than you think.

01:12.431 --> 01:15.459
Originally from Taiwan, Chang moved overseas...

01:15.531 --> 01:18.247
...to attend Harvard, Stanford and MIT...

01:18.737 --> 01:22.706
...and then went on to work at Texas Instruments for 25 years.

01:23.247 --> 01:23.979
His specialty?

01:24.465 --> 01:26.407
Electrical engineering, of course.

01:27.275 --> 01:31.327
It was in 1985, when Chang was already in his mid 50s,...

01:31.568 --> 01:33.955
...that he was contacted by the Taiwanese government...

01:34.219 --> 01:37.210
...to help grow the new industry of semiconductors.

01:37.641 --> 01:43.381
Morris Chang flew back home and in 1987, he founded TSMC...

01:43.617 --> 01:49.012
...as a joint venture mainly between the government of Taiwan and Philips Electronics.

01:49.765 --> 01:53.324
The strategy itself is simple but revolutionary.

01:53.915 --> 01:58.339
If the large American corporations just design the semiconductors...

01:58.612 --> 02:02.862
...but don't want to produce them anymore, let's create a number of foundries...

02:03.091 --> 02:05.759
...that are only dedicated to building chips.

02:06.313 --> 02:10.340
They design them, but we make them and we sell them.
