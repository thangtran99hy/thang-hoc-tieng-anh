00:00.417 --> 00:02.836
As Coca Cola and Pepsi exit Russia,...

00:02.965 --> 00:05.789
...one local firm spies an opportunity.

00:06.239 --> 00:09.687
Chernogolovka plans to fill the gap on store shelves.

00:10.055 --> 00:12.411
Since May, it's been making its own cola...

00:12.483 --> 00:14.691
...to replace products from the big names.

00:15.237 --> 00:18.191
That market is worth around 9 billion dollars.

00:18.584 --> 00:22.075
Now Chernogolovka is ramping up production to meet demand.

00:22.537 --> 00:24.961
It's almost doubled output at one plant...

00:25.153 --> 00:28.115
...and is working fast to build new facilities.

00:28.898 --> 00:32.651
PepsiCo and Coca Cola suspended production in Russia in March.

00:33.077 --> 00:37.541
Now Chernogolovka may also benefit from demand at fast food outlets.

00:37.865 --> 00:42.457
It started supplying drinks through Russian outlets of Burger King and KFC.

00:42.962 --> 00:46.794
Talks are also underway to supply Vkusno & Tochka.

00:47.263 --> 00:49.852
That's what was McDonald's renamed...

00:49.925 --> 00:53.901
...after the burger chain sold its Russian operations to a local firm.

00:54.593 --> 00:58.861
Now, international sanctions mean some supply headaches for Chernogolovka.

00:59.449 --> 01:01.316
But without Western rivals,...

01:01.437 --> 01:05.194
...the firm says growth and maybe even a stock market listing,...

01:05.360 --> 01:07.111
...are firmly on the agenda.
