00:02.191 --> 00:07.232
Countless governments and companies have taken a stab at building a city of the future.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.693
There's Songdo in South Korea,...

00:09.793 --> 00:12.594
...the Alphabet-funded Quayside Project in Toronto,...

00:12.866 --> 00:14.809
...which was abandoned in May of last year,...

00:15.180 --> 00:20.051
...and both Singapore and Barcelona have tried to modernize with smart sensors.

00:20.727 --> 00:22.027
In January of 2021,...

00:22.117 --> 00:26.658
...Saudi Arabia announced plans for its own futuristic city called The Line.

00:26.956 --> 00:30.498
Instead of communities sprawling outward from a central location,...

00:30.801 --> 00:35.196
...they would be built vertically and arranged well in a line, hence the name.

00:35.355 --> 00:39.614
Even though the vision for the city stretches 170 kilometers,...

00:39.723 --> 00:44.588
...it would do away with cars entirely, and instead be connected by high-speed rail...

00:45.049 --> 00:48.121
...that would travel the entire length in just 20 minutes.

00:48.454 --> 00:51.713
And each individual community would be largely self-contained...

00:51.791 --> 00:55.683
...so that almost anything you could need, be it a school, a doctor, or a quick meal,...

00:55.955 --> 00:57.951
...would be only a five-minute walk away.

00:58.449 --> 01:01.695
The government says The Line will run on 100% clean energy...

01:01.782 --> 01:05.818
...and make extensive use of sensors and AI to manage the city's services.

01:06.096 --> 01:09.937
And all of this is supposed to be nestled in the pristine natural landscape...

01:10.182 --> 01:13.997
...of the Tabuk Province with minimal impact on the environment.

01:14.554 --> 01:17.156
Now, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman...

01:17.233 --> 01:20.917
...has revealed grandiose renders of what the city will look like...

01:21.125 --> 01:23.306
...to match the grandiose plans.

01:23.589 --> 01:26.819
The Line is envisioned as a giant glass and mirrored wall,...

01:26.915 --> 01:31.631
...170 kilometers long, 200 meters wide and 500 meters tall.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.789
That's taller than the Empire State Building.

01:33.951 --> 01:36.235
It would have greenery stretching along the top...

01:36.372 --> 01:40.669
...an open-air ventilation system to help maintain an ideal climate year-round...

01:40.887 --> 01:43.791
...and it would house up to 9 million people.
