Whether you're discussing what movie to watch...

00:02.774 --> 00:04.461
...or pitching yourself for a promotion,...

00:04.814 --> 00:07.733
...at the end of the day, it's about getting what you want.

00:12.049 --> 00:14.087
Make sure you've done your due diligence,...

00:14.366 --> 00:15.282
...know the facts,...

00:15.392 --> 00:19.001
...and have your evidence boiled down into quick, simple, talking points.

00:20.459 --> 00:21.419
Don't be too eager.

00:21.743 --> 00:25.812
Sit back, get the lay of the land, and let them make the first move.

00:27.974 --> 00:30.713
Know what you're willing to settle for, but don't disclose it.

00:31.042 --> 00:33.321
And be willing to walk away if things go south.

00:35.061 --> 00:38.262
No matter how prepared you are, sometimes you'll be thrown a curveball.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.517
Rethink your strategy and get creative.

00:40.709 --> 00:43.319
There's always a way to bring the conversation back on track.

00:45.233 --> 00:49.528
Finally, a negotiation isn't one meeting, it's a process.

00:50.430 --> 00:51.183
So get in there.
