00:00.380 --> 00:02.143
For decades, scientists have believed...

00:02.233 --> 00:05.321
...depression is linked to lower levels of serotonin in the brain.

00:05.687 --> 00:07.275
That belief has shaped treatment...

00:07.392 --> 00:11.093
...and helped create a multibillion dollar market for antidepressant drugs.

00:11.961 --> 00:12.661
But it may be wrong.

00:13.295 --> 00:16.207
According to research published in the Journal Molecular Psychiatry,...

00:16.273 --> 00:17.612
...there is no convincing evidence...

00:17.688 --> 00:20.517
...that problems with serotonin actually cause depression.

00:20.942 --> 00:23.245
The findings stand to change the way depression is treated...

00:23.316 --> 00:25.685
...and the use of antidepressants going forward.

00:26.135 --> 00:28.760
For more, I want to bring in Dr. Mitch Prinstein.

00:28.841 --> 00:32.288
He's the chief science officer at the American Psychological Association.

00:32.364 --> 00:35.109
Dr. Prinstein, I'm gonna do something you are not supposed to do,...

00:35.185 --> 00:37.056
...which is ask you a triple-barreled question.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.219
First of all, what is serotonin,...

00:40.759 --> 00:43.675
...what did we think about it before this study,...

00:43.829 --> 00:46.286
...and what is the new way to think about it now?

00:48.047 --> 00:50.585
Sure, okay, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.

00:50.673 --> 00:54.392
It helps to move signals from one neuron in the brain...

00:54.465 --> 00:55.850
...to other neurons in the brain.

00:56.269 --> 01:02.133
We know that serotonin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs,...

01:02.532 --> 01:05.915
...Prozac, is a really common one people know about,...

01:06.065 --> 01:09.508
...has been effective in reducing symptoms of depression.

01:09.595 --> 01:13.807
So people thought that maybe a lack of serotonin was the problem,...

01:13.900 --> 01:15.905
...was the reason why people were getting depressed.

01:16.233 --> 01:19.135
Now we know that thatâ€™s probably not the best explanation.
