00:00.547 --> 00:03.209
This is a duck world, where you can feed the ducks.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.771
So have either of you been on a date here?

00:04.873 --> 00:06.124
Oh yeah, I've been on a date here.

00:06.263 --> 00:07.223
It was pretty chill.

00:07.605 --> 00:12.303
Feeding ducks, a nature stroll, or even a round of mini golf.

00:12.444 --> 00:17.053
Welcome to dating in the Metaverse, where you can come as yourself - that's me,...

00:17.276 --> 00:21.170
…or a floating robot, all from the comfort of your couch.

00:21.361 --> 00:23.949
This is our Flirtual Speed Matching World.

00:24.101 --> 00:27.948

00:34.451 --> 00:37.161
...which operates similar to a real-life dating app.

00:37.457 --> 00:40.431
Users match through profiles via their app or website,...

00:40.539 --> 00:43.312
...but instead of drinks at a bar in the neighborhood,...

00:43.529 --> 00:45.722
...hopeful singles meet up virtually.

00:45.998 --> 00:48.789
This is where I met my girlfriend two years ago.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.272
In this bar?

00:50.541 --> 00:50.945
Yeah.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.212
So when you tell people, would you say we met at a bar?

00:54.009 --> 00:54.959
I guess so.

00:56.267 --> 00:59.654
Luke Smith is a 19-year-old teen in the UK looking for love,...

00:59.771 --> 01:03.221
…both on real-life dating apps and on Flirtual.

01:03.325 --> 01:05.082
It's the same thing with online dating,...

01:05.182 --> 01:07.183
…like, it started off with the younger generation,...

01:07.288 --> 01:12.225
...but as the older generation got more used to it, they started using it, and so on.

01:12.346 --> 01:15.517
And I feel like the Metaverse will end up being the same way.

01:16.441 --> 01:19.085

...calls it a safer way to meet up.

01:29.545 --> 01:34.498
It's so normalized that when we, as women, go to like, a bar or a restaurant...

01:34.567 --> 01:37.121
...to go meet someone that we met through a dating app,...

01:37.427 --> 01:42.850
...to text multiple friends our exact GPS location to make sure that...

01:43.008 --> 01:46.766
...hey, if anything sketchy is going on, this is where I'm at.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.299
We want to change that.

01:49.441 --> 01:51.135
Plus, there's the convenience.

01:51.349 --> 01:52.995
If you have a busy work week, you know,...

01:53.065 --> 01:56.209
...you can be in your sweatpants with a glass of wine, chatting with people.

01:56.335 --> 01:59.689
And because you mostly see people as avatars first,...

01:59.853 --> 02:03.352
...fans of VR dating say it can lead to better connections.
