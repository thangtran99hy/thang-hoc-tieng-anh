"The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost.

00:07.337 --> 00:10.833
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,...

00:17.869 --> 00:22.517
...And sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler,...

00:27.900 --> 00:32.803
...long I stood and looked down one as far as I could...

00:33.233 --> 00:36.111
...To where it bent in the undergrowth;...

00:40.124 --> 00:44.560
Then took the other, as just as fair,...

00:44.832 --> 00:47.561
...And having perhaps the better claim,...

00:48.332 --> 00:51.912
...Because it was grassy and wanted wear;...

00:53.596 --> 00:59.424
...Though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same,...

01:08.283 --> 01:14.360
...And both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black.

01:17.486 --> 01:20.397
Oh, I kept the first for another day!

01:22.425 --> 01:24.925
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,...

01:25.957 --> 01:29.351
...I doubted if I should ever come back.

01:33.980 --> 01:37.212
I shall be telling this with a sigh...

01:37.737 --> 01:41.226
...Somewhere ages and ages hence:...

01:42.943 --> 01:45.850
...Two roads diverged in a wood,...

01:46.618 --> 01:51.345
...and I, I took the one less traveled by,...

01:52.839 --> 01:56.461
...And that has made all the difference.
