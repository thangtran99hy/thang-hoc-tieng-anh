There is a saying "It takes a village to raise a child."

00:04.986 --> 00:07.071
It also takes a village to support people...

00:07.192 --> 00:09.438
...living through a humanitarian crisis.

00:10.228 --> 00:14.088
This village includes affected people who are always first to respond...

00:14.364 --> 00:15.910
...when disasters strike.

00:16.363 --> 00:18.315
Neighbors helping neighbors.

00:18.948 --> 00:22.441
It includes a global community pulling together to support them...

00:22.574 --> 00:24.374
...as they recover and rebuild.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.893
And it includes hundreds of thousands...

00:26.972 --> 00:30.968
...of individual humanitarians, volunteers and professionals alike,...

00:31.661 --> 00:35.027
...delivering health care and education, food and water,...

00:35.223 --> 00:37.957
...shelter and protection, help and hope.

00:38.781 --> 00:41.529
Far from the spotlight and out of the headlines,...

00:41.623 --> 00:45.759
...humanitarians work around the clock to make our world a better place.

00:46.586 --> 00:50.233
Against incredible odds, often at great personal risk,...

00:50.661 --> 00:54.525
...they are suffering in some of the most dangerous circumstances imaginable.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.564
Today, the number of people who need humanitarian assistance...

00:58.651 --> 01:04.360
...has never been higher because of conflict, climate change, COVID-19, poverty,...

01:04.512 --> 01:07.896
...hunger and unprecedented levels of displacement.

01:08.649 --> 01:13.730
On this year's World Humanitarian Day, we celebrate humanitarians everywhere.

01:14.401 --> 01:16.565
We salute their dedication and courage...

01:16.905 --> 01:19.168
...and pay tribute to those who lost their lives...

01:19.261 --> 01:21.323
...in pursuit of this noble cause.

01:21.797 --> 01:24.671
They represent the best of humanity.
