00:00.169 --> 00:02.200
Back on the road and back on the bike.

00:02.536 --> 00:05.101
It's Bolsonaro's favorite way of campaigning.

00:06.421 --> 00:10.375
Driving through Juiz de Fora, he paraded for his fans.

00:10.912 --> 00:15.177
This is a small city that has huge significance for Bolsonaro.

00:17.873 --> 00:20.589
It was here four years ago, he was stabbed at a rally,...

00:20.873 --> 00:23.183
...a defining moment in the previous campaign...

00:23.557 --> 00:26.055
...and a moment he alluded to at today's event,...

00:26.386 --> 00:27.924
...saying he'd been born again.

00:28.957 --> 00:31.287
It was here they tried to stop us in 2018.

00:31.556 --> 00:33.473
I thank the hand of God who saved me.

00:33.782 --> 00:35.146
He wanted me to be president...

00:35.395 --> 00:36.976
...and Brazil is doing so well.

00:37.366 --> 00:40.430
It's a rich country, robbed by the left who was in power.

00:40.787 --> 00:44.412
His rival, Lula, chose to kick off his campaign at a car factory,...

00:44.589 --> 00:46.331
...staying true to his political roots...

00:46.392 --> 00:49.378
...as a union leader and metal worker in Sao Paulo.

00:51.853 --> 00:54.719
You made me the best president Brazil ever had.

00:55.298 --> 00:59.439
It's a noisy start to the campaign and says a lot about what's to come.

00:59.778 --> 01:02.265
Two men on either end of the political spectrum.

01:02.373 --> 01:07.055
Two men who conjure up both adoration and hatred among people here,...

01:07.124 --> 01:09.623
...and we'll see that play out in the coming weeks.
