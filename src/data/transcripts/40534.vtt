00:00.285 --> 00:02.760
The rising tensions between Russia and the U.S....

00:02.846 --> 00:06.854
…have sparked major questions about the future of the International Space Station.

00:07.174 --> 00:11.721
Moscow now says it intends to withdraw from the project after 2024.

00:12.113 --> 00:17.094
NASA and other international partners want to keep the station in orbit until 2030,...

00:17.326 --> 00:20.465
…but without the Russians, that may not be possible.

00:20.584 --> 00:23.587
Mark Strassman is outside the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.007
Mark, good morning.

00:26.451 --> 00:28.341
Hey Jerica, good morning to you.

00:28.433 --> 00:32.146
No question, NASA caught off guard by this announcement from Moscow...

00:32.233 --> 00:33.105
…came without warning.

00:33.347 --> 00:38.283
It has also come, still without official confirmation, to the U.S. space agency.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.703
It is really odd behavior...

00:40.811 --> 00:44.956
…given the fact that the Russians have been the U.S.'s major space partner...

00:45.033 --> 00:47.385
…internationally for the last quarter century.

00:49.060 --> 00:51.405
Already orbiting on borrowed time,...

00:51.655 --> 00:56.189
...the ISS could have its longevity shortened further by this announcement from Moscow.

00:56.675 --> 01:01.283
Yuri Borisov, Russia's new space director, tells President Vladimir Putin, quote,...

01:01.567 --> 01:05.673
"The decision to leave the station after 2024 has been made,...

01:05.929 --> 01:08.667
...so Russia can begin building its own space station".

01:09.127 --> 01:10.991
Putin's response, "Good."

01:11.263 --> 01:12.829
Do you want the relationship to end?

01:13.233 --> 01:14.334
No, absolutely not.

01:14.567 --> 01:19.517
Robyn Gatens, NASA's ISS director, taken by surprise at a conference.

01:19.751 --> 01:23.001
We haven't received any official word from the, from the partner...

01:23.163 --> 01:26.309
...as to the news today,...

01:26.415 --> 01:30.599
…and so we'll be talking more about their plan going forward.
