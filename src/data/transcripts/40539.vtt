Now that the pandemic has chased many of us out of our offices,

00:03.777 --> 00:06.505
...we're chafing under the new remote rules of work.

00:06.589 --> 00:10.573
Too much screen time, a lack of boundaries between work and home,...

00:10.935 --> 00:12.861
...it takes energy to be on,...

00:13.013 --> 00:17.176
...so, the key to managing remote work is to protect your energy.

00:17.553 --> 00:20.501
First, pay attention to ritual and routine.

00:20.669 --> 00:22.383
As much as we hated our commutes,...

00:22.495 --> 00:25.705
...they were a ritual that created a boundary between work and home.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.939
So, how can you recreate those breaks and boundaries at home?

00:29.025 --> 00:30.667
The key is to be intentional.

00:30.759 --> 00:35.101
It could be music or lighting, a pep talk with a friend.

00:35.318 --> 00:38.148
You could take a walk around the block at a certain time of day...

00:38.249 --> 00:41.392
...or even a breathing or stretching routine before you sit.

00:41.743 --> 00:46.947
Whatever it takes for you to delineate the transition between work and home.

00:47.483 --> 00:51.734
Second, we need to manage our pace, place and space.

00:51.912 --> 00:53.775
You could consider the time of day.

00:53.939 --> 00:57.671
Think about when you can typically summon the energy to be on...

00:58.012 --> 01:00.138
...and save other times for quiet work.

01:00.380 --> 01:05.549
For place, use your workspace to help you enforce good boundaries.

01:05.744 --> 01:10.541
Even if your desk is in your kitchen, make it feel like a workplace.

01:11.205 --> 01:15.152
For space, build in some alone time everyday...

01:15.390 --> 01:17.215
...and this includes time away from your kids.

01:17.423 --> 01:19.462
It's really key to avoiding burnout.

01:19.683 --> 01:23.474
Finally, if you're a manager, you have a special role to play.

01:23.639 --> 01:27.082
To help employees protect their pace, place and space.

01:27.302 --> 01:29.459
Manage the room during video calls.

01:29.713 --> 01:33.009
Even remotely, chatty extroverts tend to dominate.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.419
To create a space where everyone can be heard,...

01:35.586 --> 01:40.911
...structure agendas, assign presentation rules and minimize brainstorming.

01:41.297 --> 01:43.475
Favor audio over video calls.

01:43.686 --> 01:49.166
Research shows that we actually communicate more emotion and nuance via audio alone.

01:49.389 --> 01:54.658
Try asynchronous communication for more complicated or provocative one-on-ones.

01:54.876 --> 01:58.148
We have an opportunity, remote work is here to stay.

01:58.254 --> 02:02.964
So, don't just transfer over old habits and old company culture to remote work.
