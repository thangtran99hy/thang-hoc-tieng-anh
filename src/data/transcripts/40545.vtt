Japan's SoftBank Group has posted a 23-billion-dollar quarterly investment loss...

00:06.241 --> 00:09.606

00:09.821 --> 00:12.037

00:12.245 --> 00:14.658
It's one of the biggest losses in SoftBank's history,...

00:15.027 --> 00:19.333

00:19.454 --> 00:21.621
...and preserve cash to weather the downturn.

00:21.913 --> 00:26.020
SoftBank says share prices of a wide range of its portfolio companies have declined...

00:26.313 --> 00:31.133
...as IPO volumes plunge and markets grow more skeptical of money-losing startups.

00:31.445 --> 00:34.232
To raise money, SoftBank is selling its stake in companies...

00:34.319 --> 00:35.955

...and home-selling platform Opendoor Technologies for a total gain of 5.6 billion dollars.

00:42.037 --> 00:45.521
The tech share selloff has also hit hedge fund competitor Tiger Global,...

00:45.805 --> 00:49.593

00:49.840 --> 00:54.070
