WEBVTT

00:03.607 --> 00:04.730
Wave.

00:07.829 --> 00:08.857
I am the wave,...

00:11.243 --> 00:15.612
...the love child of water and wind, sun and moon.

00:16.585 --> 00:20.549
I move energy, nutrients, life.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.753
I move you.

00:26.761 --> 00:29.791
I've captured your imagination since the beginning of time.

00:31.276 --> 00:32.349
You honor me.

00:33.147 --> 00:34.110
You chase me.

00:35.547 --> 00:38.459
I am a symbol of something wild that exists in you,...

00:40.501 --> 00:47.657
...but lately it's I who feel wild,...

00:50.165 --> 00:55.160
...choked by your trash, overheated by your pollution.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.877
It makes me sick; it makes me lash out.

01:03.204 --> 01:05.331
Don't you know I can decimate you?

01:06.967 --> 01:13.044
What do you think I can do to your currents, your coastlines, your climate?

01:13.975 --> 01:15.781
My requirements are simple.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.539
Stop stripping the forests that keep my water clean.

01:21.133 --> 01:23.801
Stop filling the atmosphere with dead carbon...

01:25.860 --> 01:27.647
...and keep your plastic to your yourself.

01:29.955 --> 01:34.199
Work with me now before it's too late.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.503
I'll keep coming.

01:41.863 --> 01:42.695
I am the wave.
