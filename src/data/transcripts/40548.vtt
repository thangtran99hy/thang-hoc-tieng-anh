00:00.032 --> 00:03.234
Have you noticed that the price of your groceries has gone up?

00:03.912 --> 00:08.179
Bread, milk, cheese, eggs are all more expensive...

00:08.471 --> 00:11.791
...and it's something we're seeing throughout most of the globe.

00:12.227 --> 00:14.443
So what is behind the price increase?

00:14.591 --> 00:16.740
The United Nations Food Price Index...

00:16.833 --> 00:20.605
...tracks the monthly change in the price of a basket of food items.

00:20.877 --> 00:25.495
The five commodities making up this basket are cereals, vegetable oils,...

00:25.701 --> 00:28.232
...sugar, meats and dairy products.

00:28.456 --> 00:32.821
In March of 2022, the index recorded the highest price levels...

00:32.920 --> 00:34.999
...in its three-decade history.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.538
It has since come off that high slightly,...

00:37.635 --> 00:41.337
...but is still well above levels seen in previous years.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.888
The UN body's chief economist warned...

00:44.033 --> 00:47.437
...prices won't be going back to normal anytime soon.

00:47.654 --> 00:48.927
They will continue increasing...

00:49.337 --> 00:54.356
...because we will be not having the planting, or regular planting season for these two countries,...

00:54.889 --> 00:57.503
...and that could have a significant effect in the world.

00:57.683 --> 01:02.809
The two countries he's referring to here are unsurprisingly Russia and Ukraine.

01:03.292 --> 01:07.115
Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and rising energy prices...

01:07.201 --> 01:10.741
...are the two main reasons why food is getting more costly.

01:11.287 --> 01:14.149
But why is food price inflation so widespread?

01:14.607 --> 01:15.781
Let's take a closer look.

01:16.007 --> 01:17.233
Prices are really complicated.

01:17.318 --> 01:18.371
They're shaped by all sorts of things.

01:18.575 --> 01:22.174
We've had the Ukraine crisis, which has really thrown the world's food system...

01:22.247 --> 01:23.553
...into disarray in some respects.

01:23.994 --> 01:25.997
Ukraine is one of the breadbaskets of Europe.

01:26.092 --> 01:28.304
It's where we produce lots of our crops, and many of those crops...

01:28.413 --> 01:30.267
...have been unable to leave the country,...

01:30.364 --> 01:33.264
...and farmers right now in Ukraine are meant to be planting the next season's crops,...

01:33.349 --> 01:34.349
...and they haven't been able to.

01:34.571 --> 01:37.047
So we can expect these issues to continue as well.

01:37.212 --> 01:39.639
Ukraine is known for its fertile soils.

01:39.812 --> 01:43.781
It is a top exporter of sunflower oil, corn and grains.

01:44.128 --> 01:49.175
Ukraine and Russia combined produce more than a quarter of the global wheat supply.

01:49.494 --> 01:52.267
So you can understand how disruptions in these markets...

01:52.385 --> 01:55.871
...can cause massive shocks to our global food supply.
