00:00.409 --> 00:03.507
It looks like a scene from the Lord of the Rings.

00:04.009 --> 00:07.480
But just 20 miles from Iceland's capital, Reykjavik,...

00:07.582 --> 00:11.541
...it is nature that is forging a new landscape,...

00:11.927 --> 00:15.722
...smoldering, bubbling with fountains of fire.

00:16.348 --> 00:21.135
This drone footage allows us to look right into the eyes of the eruption,...

00:21.597 --> 00:23.629
...a window into the abyss.

00:24.195 --> 00:29.182
Noxious gases don't stop thousands of people trying to get as close as they can.

00:29.561 --> 00:32.514
For some, it is completely breathtaking.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.269
In fact, so many people have come that the civil defense...

00:36.375 --> 00:39.297
...has been brought in and people are being urged to stay back...

00:39.655 --> 00:42.303
...and within designated tourist areas.

00:42.671 --> 00:46.015
Lava is spewing from a 200-meter-long crack...

00:46.233 --> 00:48.685
...that appeared after a series of earthquakes...

00:49.209 --> 00:52.020
...and more openings could still form.

00:52.662 --> 00:54.484
Magma is on the move,...

00:55.041 --> 00:58.991
...but there is no immediate risk to the nearest town about six miles away...

00:59.401 --> 01:02.641
...and the nearby international airport is still open.

01:03.047 --> 01:06.411
The Reykjanes Peninsula erupted last year, too.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.474
That was after centuries of stillness.

01:09.546 --> 01:12.927
Scientists say the earth here is woken up from a deep slumber.

01:13.534 --> 01:16.099
There could be much more of this to come.
