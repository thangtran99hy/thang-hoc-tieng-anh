00:00.010 --> 00:03.921
Here are my top three principles that guide me in doing business.

00:04.355 --> 00:07.465
One, get personal with your customers.

00:07.613 --> 00:10.581
With every transaction, your customer is giving you power,...

00:10.825 --> 00:12.539
...so don't take that power for granted.

00:12.701 --> 00:15.690
We get to know our customers on a personal level...

00:15.971 --> 00:18.754
...because we take the time to really listen.

00:18.877 --> 00:21.656
Building that kind of relationship creates an authentic,...

00:21.761 --> 00:25.102
...reciprocal understanding between brand and customers.

00:25.666 --> 00:28.432
Two, don't be afraid to break the rules.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.354
So my point is, don't be afraid to try things differently.

00:32.529 --> 00:35.984
Don't expect the same rules to apply to your small business...

00:36.097 --> 00:38.284
...as I do to Fortune 500 companies.

00:38.591 --> 00:42.725
Embrace what makes you you and make it a part of your strategy...

00:42.807 --> 00:45.251
...rather than following the same old playbook...

00:45.495 --> 00:47.707
...that's out there for everyone to see.

00:47.999 --> 00:51.045
Three, make your intuition your BFF.

00:51.244 --> 00:54.497
Running a business is noisy and demanding.

00:54.865 --> 00:58.653
It's important to know who you are and who you are not.

00:58.878 --> 01:01.450
That means knowing when to say no.

01:02.081 --> 01:04.858
For me, that's meant turning down outside capital.

01:05.020 --> 01:07.465
Yeah, that extra cash flow would have been amazing,...

01:07.580 --> 01:10.799
...but investors would want to maximize profits...

01:10.999 --> 01:13.489
...and, in turn, compromise the community...

01:13.594 --> 01:15.871
...and culture aspects of what we stand for.

01:16.001 --> 01:19.013
And for me, that's non-negotiable.

01:19.803 --> 01:21.915
At the end of the day, you have to be grateful.

01:22.095 --> 01:25.047
No one has to work for you and no one has to be your customer.

01:25.318 --> 01:26.423
People have choices,...

01:26.587 --> 01:31.208
...so remember to appreciate every employee effort and every sale.
