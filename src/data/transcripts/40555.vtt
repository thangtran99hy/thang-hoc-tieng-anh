According to legend, over a thousand years ago,...

00:03.541 --> 00:08.099
...in the mountains of Ethiopia, there lived a goat herder named Kaldi.

00:08.366 --> 00:11.768
One day, he noticed something kind of strange.

00:12.202 --> 00:15.779
His goats had been browsing on the berries of a small tree...

00:16.167 --> 00:20.018
...and this seemed to make them unusually peppy,...

00:20.399 --> 00:22.931
...jumping around and unwilling to go to sleep at night.

00:23.251 --> 00:27.473
After trying the berries himself, Kaldi reported them to others...

00:27.553 --> 00:29.850
...who roasted, dissolved and drank them.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.107
Thus, the cup of coffee was born.
