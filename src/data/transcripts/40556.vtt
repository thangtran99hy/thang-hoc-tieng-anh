Imagine you're out camping somewhere remote...

00:03.463 --> 00:06.205
...and you realize you need something from a convenience store.

00:06.401 --> 00:09.275
Could be some water, some ice, a snack,...

00:09.469 --> 00:12.939
...and then imagine such items being flown several kilometers...

00:13.131 --> 00:15.203
...and dropped right where you are.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.479
Well, this is now a reality in Korea,...

00:18.766 --> 00:22.178
...and it's just the start of drone delivery services here.

00:22.781 --> 00:25.808
In the case of CU, a major chain in Korea,...

00:26.055 --> 00:28.823
...it started offering drone deliveries this month...

00:28.971 --> 00:33.446
...from its convenience store in the eastern county of Yeongwol, Gangwon Province.

00:33.698 --> 00:40.360
Available on Fridays and Saturdays to campus using a designated facility 3.6 kilometers away,...

00:40.567 --> 00:43.311
...products can be delivered for free via a drone...

00:43.485 --> 00:49.877
...measuring 70 centimeters in height within ten minutes of purchases being ordered via an app.

00:50.147 --> 00:51.709
And CU is not the only one.

00:51.900 --> 00:57.015
7-Eleven has also just opened a store with a drone station in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province,...

00:57.169 --> 01:01.946
...offering deliveries over a distance of a kilometer in less than three minutes...

01:02.213 --> 01:07.588
...also for free and also limited for now to customers using nearby lodging facilities.

01:08.155 --> 01:12.535
These services are set to expand when government regulations ease further...

01:12.820 --> 01:16.943
...after officials announced plans last month to support the industry's progress.
