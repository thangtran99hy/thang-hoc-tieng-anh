Harper has a conductive hearing loss.

00:02.455 --> 00:06.895
She wears the Cochlear Baha devices and she loves to come to the track.

00:09.557 --> 00:11.170
My name is Harper Gage.

00:11.323 --> 00:12.449
I'm six years old.

00:12.648 --> 00:17.074
I race go-kart, and I have hearing loss in both ears.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.749
She's missing bones inside of her ears,...

00:19.853 --> 00:22.795
...so the Baha transmits the vibrations of sound.

00:23.161 --> 00:29.115
I don't wear my Bahas when I race because they don't fit under my helmet.

00:29.539 --> 00:31.349
I love to go fast.

00:32.033 --> 00:36.224
My dad used to race, but now he stopped to help me.

00:36.714 --> 00:39.308
I go 50 miles per hour.

00:40.409 --> 00:47.098
It is so fun to go fast and win trophies.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.839
I have 15 trophies.
