00:05.711 --> 00:07.772
Are you ready for this resume?

00:07.854 --> 00:12.562
Okay, she is in two undergraduate programs studying biology,...

00:12.685 --> 00:13.571
...I can't even say it,...

00:14.168 --> 00:15.837
...biological sciences.

00:16.037 --> 00:19.524
She's a former NASA intern, and now she's going to medical school.

00:19.597 --> 00:20.113
And guess what?

00:21.380 --> 00:22.435
She's 13 years old.

00:22.537 --> 00:23.168
Oh man.

00:23.233 --> 00:27.733
Alena Analeigh, so great to have you here in Times Square.

00:27.811 --> 00:30.329
I'm glad I got a chance during the commercial break early...

00:30.403 --> 00:32.546
...to go hang out with you in the green room,...

00:32.623 --> 00:35.088
...and I don't know how you do it all.

00:35.263 --> 00:37.278
What has been on your vision board?

00:37.351 --> 00:38.605
What are your goals?

00:39.134 --> 00:43.952
My goals right now are to definitely make it through college,...

00:44.821 --> 00:46.045
...so I can go into med school...

00:46.204 --> 00:50.179
...because after I was accepted, it was the most amazing moment.

00:51.542 --> 00:58.551
And just knowing that I've reached the goal of getting into med school at this age,...

00:59.029 --> 01:02.214
...at thirteen, was amazing for me...

01:03.195 --> 01:08.773
...because my goal was to become a bioimmunologist, the study of viruses,...

01:11.323 --> 01:13.049
...and really help communities.

01:13.148 --> 01:14.311
I wanted to get involved.

01:14.389 --> 01:16.459
I love to volunteer.

01:16.854 --> 01:19.110
I've done that since I was young, like when I wasâ€¦

01:19.185 --> 01:19.867
You are young.

01:24.275 --> 01:28.359
I mean like, once I was, when I was three, five, around there.

01:29.357 --> 01:34.712
I always loved going out and volunteering, like feeding the homeless,...

01:34.799 --> 01:38.805
...and doing projects with girls, and mentoring,...

01:38.900 --> 01:41.930
...and it was a big part of my life.
