00:01.311 --> 00:03.299
Tensions over Taiwan have soared.

00:03.518 --> 00:05.701
A visit from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi...

00:05.793 --> 00:08.234
…and comments from other U.S. officials about the island...

00:08.319 --> 00:09.695
…have infuriated China.

00:16.033 --> 00:19.085
The self-ruled island has grown into a durable democracy...

00:19.154 --> 00:20.853
…and major semiconductor producer.

00:21.597 --> 00:24.175
The U.S. has promised to help it defend itself.

00:24.717 --> 00:26.980
Are you willing to get involved militarily...

00:27.061 --> 00:28.988
...to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?

00:29.415 --> 00:29.860
Yes.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.587
But the problem is, China sees it as part of its own territory...

00:33.667 --> 00:35.633
…and has threatened to seize it if necessary.

00:35.797 --> 00:40.783
Over the past year, the Chinese military has also sent dozens of planes,...

00:40.907 --> 00:44.601
…bombers, and fighter jets into the airspace close to Taiwan.

00:45.715 --> 00:50.088
So as Taiwan is perhaps the most explosive issue in U.S.-China relations,...

00:50.225 --> 00:52.189
...here's how we got here and what's next.

00:54.113 --> 00:57.558
The first thing to know is that Taiwan, which is located off China's coast,...

00:57.633 --> 00:59.911
…has been self-governed since 1949.

01:00.105 --> 01:02.859
That's when the Communist Party took power in mainland China...

01:02.933 --> 01:04.872
…and some nationalists fled to the island.

01:05.633 --> 01:09.568
For China, Taiwan is seen as always been the one that got away.

01:09.970 --> 01:13.645
When the Chinese Communist Party first founded the People's Republic of China,...

01:14.057 --> 01:17.198
…Taiwan was never a part of the People's Republic.

01:17.570 --> 01:20.219
Instead, it was governed by the Kuomintang Party...

01:20.660 --> 01:24.275
…that had fled to the island after a brutal civil war.

01:24.408 --> 01:29.239
Ever since then, every Chinese leader has sought to reunify Taiwan with the mainland.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.943
And that includes President Xi Jinping who has made bringing Taiwan...

01:33.013 --> 01:35.779
…under mainland control a key goal of his legacy.
