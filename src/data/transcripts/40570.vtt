00:01.667 --> 00:03.257
Fasten your seat belts.

00:04.007 --> 00:09.070
We are traveling to Egypt more than 2,000 years ago:...

00:09.643 --> 00:12.677
...the age of the great pharaohs.

00:17.544 --> 00:21.062
Hey, Emily, what's that woman doing on that throne?

00:21.611 --> 00:23.526
And why are those men carrying it?

00:25.151 --> 00:27.515
That must be pretty boring work, huh?

00:30.877 --> 00:33.488
That's Cleopatra, the pharaoh of Egypt.

00:34.106 --> 00:37.279
The Egyptians worked hard to build their pyramids.

00:38.679 --> 00:44.221
Excuse me, Cleopatra, why do you have such a big house just for you?

00:46.505 --> 00:50.189
Dear child, what you're calling a house is actually a pyramid,...

00:50.451 --> 00:52.527
...a temple where they bury pharaohs.

00:54.797 --> 00:58.565
When a pharaoh dies, he's embalmed and placed here forever.

01:01.673 --> 01:03.522
I don't want to be a pharaoh then.

01:03.988 --> 01:08.059
I want to be a farmer or a merchant and travel on the Nile.
