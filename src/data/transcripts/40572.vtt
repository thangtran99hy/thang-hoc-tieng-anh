00:02.364 --> 00:03.191
Eggplant.

00:07.577 --> 00:11.904
Grilled cheese and tomato soup from Panera.

00:15.661 --> 00:18.253
So they like to call this cotton candy,...

00:18.819 --> 00:21.553
...even though in England, it's called candy floss,...

00:23.208 --> 00:28.725
...but really, cotton candy makes more sense than candy floss.

00:31.627 --> 00:34.497
You can't floss with it, can you?

00:39.541 --> 00:40.405
What is that?

00:44.143 --> 00:45.277
Oh no, that stumped me.

00:46.274 --> 00:47.707
I'm going to have to open it.

00:49.369 --> 00:51.195
Courgette, that's courgette, isn't it?

00:51.697 --> 00:55.550
But in America, I want to say it, but I could be wrong.

00:55.647 --> 00:56.791
Is it zucchini?

00:57.278 --> 00:57.993
It's zucchini.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.951
See, I always thought zucchini was pasta.

01:00.969 --> 01:01.865
That's a zucchini.

01:03.153 --> 01:04.104
Next dish.

01:08.703 --> 01:10.478
I always get confused with this.

01:11.065 --> 01:12.508
They'd call it a cookie, wouldn't they?

01:13.399 --> 01:16.103
But a scone they'd call a biscuit.

01:21.401 --> 01:25.139
Actually, I'm going to have to agree with the Americans on this one.

01:25.811 --> 01:27.187
I do say french fries.

01:27.265 --> 01:29.871
I don't say chips unless it's fish and chips.

01:30.563 --> 01:31.445
Then I have to say fish and chips,...

01:31.543 --> 01:33.392
...so I'm not going to say fish and french fries.

01:34.187 --> 01:37.101
So I'm going to have to go with the Americans again on this one.

01:37.202 --> 01:38.380
I do say french fries.
