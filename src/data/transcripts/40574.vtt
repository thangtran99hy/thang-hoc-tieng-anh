00:00.631 --> 00:05.011
Three decades ago, a Vietnamese businessman began making a fortune...

00:05.137 --> 00:07.713
...selling dried noodle soup in Ukraine.

00:08.317 --> 00:13.478
Today, that same man wants to build an EV business in America.

00:14.506 --> 00:18.016
VinFast is the brand, and it is laying the foundation...

00:18.085 --> 00:20.908
...to become a serious contender in the United States...

00:21.006 --> 00:22.741
…and elsewhere around the world.

00:23.113 --> 00:25.672
In fact, it is moving aggressively.

00:26.621 --> 00:30.839
VinFast, a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup,...

00:30.949 --> 00:33.791
…only began selling cars in 2019,...

00:34.293 --> 00:38.669
…but it has already invested $2 billion in a factory in North Carolina...

00:38.899 --> 00:44.186
…and has plans to open 30 showrooms in California by the end of 2022.

00:44.681 --> 00:47.071
It is also planning a U.S. IPO.

00:47.521 --> 00:50.287
The U.S. market has a huge potential.

00:50.649 --> 00:55.430
If you talk about the number of vehicles running on the streets right now,...

00:55.525 --> 00:57.011
…it's really a huge potential.

00:57.303 --> 01:00.762
The company has yet to sell a single car in the U.S.,...

01:01.073 --> 01:05.564
…and it only sold 35,000 cars in Vietnam in 2021.

01:05.973 --> 01:08.048
Most of them were gas-powered.

01:08.421 --> 01:11.814
Other foreign automakers have spent years building their businesses...

01:11.887 --> 01:15.241
...in their home markets before attempting to enter the United States.

01:15.689 --> 01:17.557
VinFast is not waiting.

01:17.829 --> 01:23.039
They are going from 0 to 100 in a matter of nanoseconds.

01:23.145 --> 01:27.612
It is just one of countless new companies trying to enter the EV business.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.415
A lot of them are underfunded.

01:29.806 --> 01:31.341
A lot of them will not make it.

01:31.646 --> 01:34.837
Getting into the vehicle space itself, into the automotive industry...

01:35.164 --> 01:36.987
...is a tough slog to climb.

01:37.081 --> 01:39.629
It has yet to be seen if the buying public...

01:39.702 --> 01:42.604
...is willing to put down 40, 50, 60,000 dollars...

01:42.831 --> 01:46.675
...on a new unknown brand from a country that has never built a vehicle before.

01:47.204 --> 01:50.539
And VinFast is an unknown brand from Vietnam,...

01:50.677 --> 01:54.666
…a country with no international reputation for auto manufacture,...

01:55.376 --> 01:59.708
...but it is under the wing of the 5.4 billion dollar Vingroup conglomerate...

01:59.913 --> 02:02.029
…owned by that country's richest man.

02:02.467 --> 02:07.661
They've been in property, in education, in software, in motorcycles for years,...

02:07.862 --> 02:10.077
…and whatever they've touched has turned to gold.

02:10.473 --> 02:11.895
So, they feel quite confident.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.012
Hey, we win where we go.

02:14.325 --> 02:15.905
Why not electric vehicles too?
