There are a ton of influencers on social media.

00:04.642 --> 00:06.269
I'm thinking about all the folks who have...

00:06.469 --> 00:09.687
...content creator in their bios and have impeccable skin.

00:10.193 --> 00:13.287
The influencer community has grown a lot in recent years.

00:13.429 --> 00:17.010
Data from Influencer Marketing Hub found that the industry is set to grow...

00:17.093 --> 00:21.004
...to approximately 16.4 billion dollars in 2022,...

00:21.165 --> 00:25.788
...and last year, the global number of influencer marketing-related services,...

00:26.029 --> 00:30.435
...companies that helped creators grow their brand, grew by 26 percent.

00:30.633 --> 00:33.189
There are a lot of major players here,...

00:33.342 --> 00:37.617
...including social platforms, advertisers, influencers,...

00:37.735 --> 00:39.773
...and agencies that manage content creators.

00:39.979 --> 00:42.023
As the industry is growing in value,...

00:42.310 --> 00:44.977
...we wanted to break down how different platforms are working...

00:45.055 --> 00:48.039
...to compensate influencers fairly for their content.

00:48.164 --> 00:50.979
Influencer agencies say micro influencers,...

00:51.081 --> 00:54.315
...someone that has between 10,000 and 50,000 followers,...

00:54.440 --> 00:58.741
...can make anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 dollars a year.

00:58.947 --> 01:00.928
Big-time celebrity influencers...

01:01.036 --> 01:06.111
...like Charlie D'Amelio, Addison Rae, and Bretman Rock make way more.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.716
One way they make money is through brand deals.

01:09.077 --> 01:11.989
On platforms like Instagram, a picture of an influencer...

01:12.066 --> 01:14.583
...holding or wearing a product and endorsing it...

01:14.726 --> 01:17.579
...can bring in a decent amount of cash.

01:17.690 --> 01:23.282
Someone with one million followers may charge brands up to 10,000 dollars per post,...

01:23.385 --> 01:25.965
...according to influencer agency Viral Nation.

01:26.087 --> 01:30.093
Within the last two years, Instagram rolled out new monetization features...

01:30.171 --> 01:33.165
...where creators could make money directly through the app,...

01:33.259 --> 01:35.312
...instead of just from brand partnerships.

01:35.377 --> 01:37.212
They introduced their affiliate program...

01:37.294 --> 01:40.011
...where creators can share products with their followers...

01:40.141 --> 01:41.789
...and earn a commission from purchases...

01:41.899 --> 01:45.221
...and they made it easier for creators to sell their own merchandise.

01:45.345 --> 01:48.799
Influencers can also earn money from IGTV ads,...

01:49.021 --> 01:51.706
...but Instagram acknowledges more can be done.

01:51.958 --> 01:55.323
By the end of 2022, they plan to invest over one billion dollars...

01:55.399 --> 01:58.389
...in programs that give creators new ways to earn money.
