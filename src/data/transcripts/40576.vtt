Material scientist, Dr. Johnny Drain,...

00:05.219 --> 00:08.142
...likes to wonder what things could be made of,...

00:08.727 --> 00:10.843
...whether it's a smartphone screen,...

00:10.978 --> 00:13.797
...the Michelin star restaurant dishes he's created,...

00:14.069 --> 00:18.082
...or wanting to figure out how to replace cocoa.

00:19.908 --> 00:23.062
This is the lab on the boat where the chocolate story begins.

00:23.225 --> 00:23.953
Oh wow.

00:24.019 --> 00:24.601
Come on board.

00:24.855 --> 00:25.737
Thank you.

00:27.297 --> 00:28.015
What's this?

00:28.384 --> 00:30.739
So this is some of the ingredients...

00:30.925 --> 00:32.923
...that we started developing the chocolate with.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.000
Kinky salts?

00:34.129 --> 00:34.950
Kinky salts.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.665
That's various funky salts...

00:36.757 --> 00:39.319
...from different places all over the world on my travels.

00:39.772 --> 00:40.605
Dried shrimp.

00:40.803 --> 00:41.750
That's not in the chocolate, is it?

00:41.831 --> 00:43.599
That is not, and there's some raw cacao,...

00:43.708 --> 00:45.668
...which we were trying to imitate at the very start.

00:45.791 --> 00:48.673
But of all the things we try to find replacements for,...

00:48.910 --> 00:51.205
...cocoa may not be an obvious one.

00:51.513 --> 00:54.559
What most people don't realize about cocoa chocolate is that...

00:55.027 --> 00:56.884
...about seventy percent of it...

00:56.947 --> 01:00.881
...is produced in just two countries in West Africa, Ghana and Ivory Coast,...

01:01.226 --> 01:04.640
...in a way that involves outsized water consumption,...

01:04.720 --> 01:07.952
...so about 20,000 liters of water per kilo,...

01:08.166 --> 01:10.825
...and that's way more than beef or soy or avocados.

01:10.950 --> 01:13.142
And there are issues with labor in those parts of the world.

01:13.245 --> 01:14.649
At a conservative estimate,...

01:14.757 --> 01:20.349
...it's thought that 1.5 million children are on these cacao farms...

01:20.446 --> 01:22.029
...working with their families predominantly.

01:22.148 --> 01:26.010
Is this, however, not taking away income from countries that really need it?

01:26.215 --> 01:27.915
Those countries do need that income,...

01:27.977 --> 01:30.233
...and those hardworking farmers need to be supported,...

01:30.572 --> 01:33.495
...but the state of the current cacao and chocolate industry...

01:33.556 --> 01:36.834
...is such that those people are working on a dollar or less a day,...

01:37.144 --> 01:38.944
...and it's not an equitable trade.
