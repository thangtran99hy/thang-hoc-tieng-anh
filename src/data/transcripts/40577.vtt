00:00.243 --> 00:03.255
Space, the filthy frontier.

00:04.055 --> 00:09.851
Humans successfully put their first object into space in 1957: the Sputnik satellite.

00:10.304 --> 00:14.194
And after 75 years of spacecraft being sent into orbit,...

00:14.447 --> 00:19.150
...it's a lot easier to go for launch, but a lot messier once you're up there.

00:22.277 --> 00:25.123
Governments now have to share space with private companies,...

00:25.434 --> 00:30.217
...and without much in the way of regulation, it's starting to get so congested...

00:30.401 --> 00:32.497
...we don't know exactly what's up there anymore.

00:33.054 --> 00:36.235
Some estimates say around 5,000 satellites in orbit...

00:36.494 --> 00:38.849
...with fewer than half actually working.

00:39.318 --> 00:42.987
And when a satellite stops functioning, it still keeps orbiting,...

00:43.263 --> 00:45.180
...which is a problem for the useful ones.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.047
Satellites, when they die on these orbital highways,...

00:48.130 --> 00:50.525
...they just keep on going at these very fast speeds.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.727
Some of the relative speeds between satellites that are crisscrossing each other,...

00:55.009 --> 00:56.977
...it's like 15 times the speed of a bullet,...

00:57.331 --> 01:00.548
...so that's pretty gnarly to think about.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.517
And every once in a while, ...

01:03.607 --> 01:08.465
...two of these things find each other in space at these very high speeds, collide,...

01:08.567 --> 01:11.310
...and break up into very smaller pieces and that sort of stuff.

01:11.693 --> 01:14.289
And most of the things that could damage a satellite...

01:14.541 --> 01:17.103
...that's providing a service or a capability that we care about,...

01:17.516 --> 01:20.297
...most of those things are not trackable because they're too small.

01:20.989 --> 01:24.517
Moriba's co-founder of Privateer, which tracks space debris.

01:24.731 --> 01:28.076
It aims to collect information from many different origins,...

01:28.233 --> 01:31.974
...like telescopes and radars, physical sensors, even news articles,...

01:32.095 --> 01:34.949
...and turn it into usable data for developers.

01:35.287 --> 01:38.005
Imagine a massive machine-readable spreadsheet,...

01:38.356 --> 01:41.275
...where all the data is lined up so the column headings make sense.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.355
It's one of many companies and space agencies...

01:44.425 --> 01:49.405
...taking part in the Summit for Space Sustainability at London's Science Museum.

01:50.189 --> 01:53.409
These are the people hoping to clean up up there.

01:54.285 --> 01:55.899
And it's harder than you think...

01:56.055 --> 02:00.007
...because you can't exactly use a vacuum cleaner in a vacuum.
