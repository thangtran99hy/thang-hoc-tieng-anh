Apple says many of its most popular products are vulnerable to hacking...

00:04.097 --> 00:07.355
…and is urging millions of its users to make security updates...

00:07.415 --> 00:08.702
…and to do it now.

00:09.130 --> 00:13.693
The warning says hackers could gain control of some devices, including its iPhones.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.812
Michael George is here with the latest.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.834
Michael, I was one of many busy making that update yesterday.

00:18.907 --> 00:19.437
Good morning.

00:19.642 --> 00:19.995
Good morning.

00:20.071 --> 00:21.087
A lot of people were doing that.

00:21.169 --> 00:23.630
When we usually get that notification "update our phones",...

00:23.694 --> 00:27.726
…a lot of us ignore it, but this time, experts say don't wait.

00:28.012 --> 00:31.183
There's a security loophole that could let hackers take control of your phone,...

00:31.446 --> 00:32.947
…and the latest update can fix it.

00:34.300 --> 00:39.077
Apple users going to the tech giant's updated page will find easy fix instructions...

00:39.147 --> 00:42.517
…on what to do next to prevent a break-in to their devices.

00:42.937 --> 00:46.465
But Apple also explains quote, "For the protection of our customers,...

00:46.721 --> 00:50.523
…Apple doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues...

00:50.833 --> 00:52.631
…until an investigation has occurred...

00:52.845 --> 00:55.317
…and patches or releases are generally available."

00:55.500 --> 00:57.359
This is what we call a zero-day vulnerability,...

00:57.443 --> 01:02.206
…when it's been exploited by hacker before the company, in this case Apple,...

01:02.327 --> 01:04.446
…have detected it and been able to do something about it.
