If you're like many music fans,...

00:02.109 --> 00:06.647
…the soundtrack of your life overlaps with the soundtrack to Grease,...

00:06.999 --> 00:10.148
…whether you're in your 70s or your teens.

00:10.605 --> 00:14.695
Many of those timeless songs were sung by Olivia Newton-John.

00:15.171 --> 00:18.603
So, what better way to honor her than by singing too?

00:19.356 --> 00:22.495
Like this a cappella version of "Hopelessly Devoted to You"...

00:22.595 --> 00:25.636
...by 28-year-old country star, Kelsea Ballerini.

00:25.949 --> 00:28.269
Same ballad posted by Julianne Hough,..

00:28.629 --> 00:31.979
…who played Sandy in Grease Live back in 2016.

00:32.468 --> 00:36.817
She writes, "Like so many, Olivia has always been my hero".

00:38.500 --> 00:42.522
Kristin Chenoweth shared her rendition from the TV show "Pushing Daisies,"...

00:42.771 --> 00:46.079
…along with a message, "For Olivia. I love you."

00:46.335 --> 00:47.693
"You were everything to me."

00:48.147 --> 00:51.901
And fellow Australian superstars Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban wrote,...

00:52.129 --> 00:54.873
"Livvie brought the most divine light into the world.

00:55.110 --> 00:58.253
We will always be hopelessly devoted to you."

00:58.684 --> 01:00.729
It's a sentiment echoed across the globe,...

01:00.900 --> 01:03.971
…from Australia, where landmarks turned pink in her honor,...

01:04.233 --> 01:07.898
...to Hollywood, where fans left flowers on her Walk of Fame star.

01:08.543 --> 01:11.009
My mom was scared to even tell me the news this morning...

01:11.089 --> 01:13.397
…because she knew I'd cry like a baby, and I did.
