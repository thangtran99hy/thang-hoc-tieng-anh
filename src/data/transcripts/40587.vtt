00:00.967 --> 00:04.441
The latest projections by the UN suggest the world population...

00:04.519 --> 00:08.558
...could grow to around 8.5 billion by the end of this decade,...

00:09.025 --> 00:15.683
...9.7 billion by 2050 and expected to peak at around 10.4 billion...

00:15.760 --> 00:20.688
...during the 2080s and remain at that level until 2100.

00:21.554 --> 00:26.499
The report also points to half the projected increase in global population...

00:26.577 --> 00:30.054
...rise up to 2050 coming from just eight countries,...

00:30.127 --> 00:31.245
...five in Africa:...

00:31.655 --> 00:33.328
...The Democratic Republic of Congo,...

00:33.573 --> 00:33.927
...Egypt,...

00:34.203 --> 00:34.921
...Ethiopia,...

00:35.020 --> 00:35.363
...India,...

00:35.429 --> 00:36.039
...Nigeria,...

00:36.143 --> 00:36.835
...Pakistan,...

00:37.240 --> 00:38.777
...The Philippines and Tanzania.

00:39.183 --> 00:43.673
With warnings coming from the UN that with rapid population growth...

00:44.108 --> 00:48.375
...comes greater difficulties in eradicating poverty and combating hunger...

00:48.887 --> 00:53.583
...while the need to increase health care and education coverage becomes key.

00:54.025 --> 00:56.322
And while India is expected to become...

00:56.452 --> 00:59.577
...the most populous nation in the world later this year,...

01:00.080 --> 01:02.395
...global population growth has slowed,...

01:02.725 --> 01:05.573
...with global fertility expected to keep declining...

01:05.661 --> 01:09.075
...from around five births per woman in the 1950s...

01:09.607 --> 01:13.565
...to around 2.1 births per woman by 2050.

01:14.069 --> 01:20.206
Global population will continue to grow and could reach 9.7 billion in 2050.

01:20.967 --> 01:24.839
It is projected to reach a peak of around 10.4 billion people...

01:25.055 --> 01:29.157
...during the 2080s and to remain at that level until 2100.

01:30.366 --> 01:35.363
The projected global population of 10.4 billion at the end of the century...

01:36.139 --> 01:41.061
...is more than a half a billion lower than what we projected three years ago.

01:42.195 --> 01:44.271
The report also says that globally,...

01:44.353 --> 01:48.186
...the world counts slightly more men than women in 2022,...

01:48.493 --> 01:54.074
...at a ratio of 50.3% for men and 49.7% for women,...

01:54.709 --> 01:58.219
...a ratio expected to be equal by 2050.
