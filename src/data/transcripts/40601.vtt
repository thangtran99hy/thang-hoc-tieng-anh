00:00.155 --> 00:01.974
This used to be a mangrove forest.

00:02.763 --> 00:04.965
It is absolutely decimated.

00:06.531 --> 00:08.703
This is what climate change looks like.

00:09.561 --> 00:14.462
The mangroves died along 2,000 kilometers of shoreline...

00:14.566 --> 00:16.559
...in the Gulf of Carpentaria.

00:16.849 --> 00:24.175
There was 76 square kilometers, that's  7,600 hectares of mangroves, were killed.

00:27.193 --> 00:32.204
These studies have identified what killed them was a drop in sea level...

00:32.447 --> 00:37.220
...that occurred with a very severe El Nino at the time.

00:37.435 --> 00:42.566
We've known about the drops in sea level correlated with El Nino,...

00:42.675 --> 00:45.251
...but strangely enough, these impacts,...

00:45.419 --> 00:48.245
...even though, as big as they are on mangroves,...

00:48.346 --> 00:50.818
...they haven't been noticed or recognized before.

00:54.461 --> 00:57.403
The dieback was caused by a lack of moisture.

00:57.655 --> 00:58.029
Yeah.

00:58.488 --> 01:03.541
So what we need to do is find a way to water these plants on scale,...

01:03.820 --> 01:06.809
...aerial watering or even watering from ships.

01:07.933 --> 01:13.115
There's five or six times more carbon in mangrove forests than most other forests.

01:13.689 --> 01:18.719
We can just keep these trees alive and the habitat intact.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.617
Then we can preserve these benefits.
