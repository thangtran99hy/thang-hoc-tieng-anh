00:00.320 --> 00:03.092
This is "The Economics of IKEA,"...

00:03.511 --> 00:08.053
...a look at the innovative business practices that have transformed modern life.

00:09.261 --> 00:10.871
When you step into an IKEA,...

00:10.976 --> 00:17.802
...you immediately are put into this maze-like path of different rooms.

00:18.292 --> 00:21.317
IKEA's store layout is a fixed path design,...

00:21.532 --> 00:23.249
...which means there's a designated road...

00:23.481 --> 00:27.533
...that all customers must follow that guides you through the store in one direction.

00:28.393 --> 00:32.350
It's not a grab a carton of milk and get out kind of store.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.815
It's the opposite of that.

00:35.454 --> 00:40.064
It's very much set up to spend a day, think about rooms,...

00:40.408 --> 00:43.461
...dream about what you really want your bedroom to look like.

00:45.055 --> 00:48.889
The floor plan of most IKEA stores resembles a maze...

00:49.188 --> 00:53.805
...that curves about every 50 feet to keep customers curious about what comes next.

00:54.227 --> 00:57.808
Since an average IKEA store is around 300,000 square feet,...

00:58.096 --> 01:01.649
...or five American football fields, that means a lot of walking.

01:01.951 --> 01:05.554
An IKEA is, to some, frustratingly winding,...

01:06.097 --> 01:09.767
...but really it's laid out as an experience to get you to buy more.

01:11.694 --> 01:14.753
IKEA is famous for putting its customers to work.

01:15.127 --> 01:18.344
Unlike most furniture retailers that sell products preassembled,...

01:18.750 --> 01:22.347
...many of IKEA's pieces have to be built by their customers.

01:22.947 --> 01:23.742
But why?

01:23.979 --> 01:26.233
As many couples and their therapists well know,...

01:26.449 --> 01:29.534
...building your own IKEA cabinet can be challenging.

01:29.754 --> 01:32.079
The big idea behind the IKEA effect...

01:32.501 --> 01:36.475
...is consumers are more attached to have more positive feelings...

01:36.636 --> 01:39.877
...towards objects or things that we've put effort into...

01:40.053 --> 01:43.819
...and that we actually think that they're more valuable because of that.

01:45.361 --> 01:50.113
The term "IKEA effect" was first coined in 2011 by researchers...

01:50.399 --> 01:53.656
...who noticed a similar phenomena in other products and businesses.

01:54.549 --> 01:58.235
When instant cake mixes were first introduced in the 1950s,...

01:58.444 --> 01:59.558
...they didn't sell well.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.235
And then they said, let's add a fresh egg.

02:02.437 --> 02:06.439
It was this idea that we want to feel like we're just participating enough...

02:06.537 --> 02:08.748
...to not feel guilty about taking a shortcut.

02:09.912 --> 02:13.725
When you make a cake from a mix, which do you want, a fresh egg cake...

02:13.905 --> 02:18.091
...or a cake made with dried eggs for higher, lighter, tastier cake?

02:18.308 --> 02:19.906
Why, fresh eggs, of course.

02:20.143 --> 02:25.859
The idea that we should love building products isn't necessarily what IKEA intended.
