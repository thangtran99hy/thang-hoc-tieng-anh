00:00.699 --> 00:02.972
Sheet feeder without feed rolls.

00:03.240 --> 00:06.407
No crushing of boards and protection of material...

00:06.588 --> 00:08.637
...when feeding into the machine.

00:09.187 --> 00:14.129
New developed vacuum sheet transport minimized wear operation...

00:14.234 --> 00:16.241
...over extremely long periods.

00:16.615 --> 00:20.089
No periodic exchange of transport medium.

00:21.285 --> 00:24.031
Real servo direct drive technology,...

00:24.286 --> 00:27.089
...individual servo drives per printing unit...

00:27.214 --> 00:30.646
...enables highest precision in printing register...

00:30.879 --> 00:33.520
...due to extensive control options.

00:34.846 --> 00:39.425
Maximum precision and die cutting especially for multi-out production.

00:39.803 --> 00:44.733
Maximum four up due to a separate die cutting length correction.

00:45.141 --> 00:48.121
For each row of outs in running direction,...

00:48.193 --> 00:52.290
...the length can be set individually at the main control panel.

00:53.565 --> 00:57.984
Fully automatic change of analogs roll in less than two minutes.

00:58.227 --> 01:00.532
Highly automated setup processes...

01:00.742 --> 01:04.868
...reduce the time required for the job changes to a minimum.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.121
After a one-time fully automatic test run,...

01:08.313 --> 01:10.629
...saleable products are produced.

01:11.977 --> 01:15.533
Top vacuum stacker approach to zero defect production...

01:15.763 --> 01:18.342
...through improved disposal of waste.

01:18.875 --> 01:21.181
And these are just a few of the features...

01:21.333 --> 01:25.243
...that identify both the CorruCUT high board line rotary die cutter...

01:25.405 --> 01:29.303
...and the CorruFLEX Flexo Postprinter from Koenig & Bauer.

01:29.397 --> 01:32.035
...as a technically leading solution.

01:33.021 --> 01:36.527
Industry 4.0, 24/7 service support...

01:36.701 --> 01:40.684
