00:00.463 --> 00:05.063
Our presses are connected since 1994,...

00:05.387 --> 00:08.887
...so since more than 25 years.

00:09.385 --> 00:17.114
But today, we are receiving up to 100,000 sets of data per press and per day.

00:17.778 --> 00:22.153
And the key is to evaluate and interpret the data...

00:22.501 --> 00:24.749
...and take action from these findings,...

00:25.422 --> 00:29.993
...which enables us to offer tailor-made solutions and services...

00:30.352 --> 00:34.309
...fitting your individual production conditions.

00:35.013 --> 00:39.920
But before we talk about a few of these unique solutions,...

00:40.389 --> 00:44.600
...let's experience what features our Rapida 145...

00:45.013 --> 00:47.117
...are minimizing maintenance time.

00:48.871 --> 00:52.052
Minimizing maintenance time is a very good keyword...

00:52.163 --> 00:55.833
...because this is the focal point of our latest development...

00:56.067 --> 00:58.144
...for the new large format generation.

00:59.440 --> 01:03.439
We are eliminating and centralizing lubrication points.

01:03.985 --> 01:08.529
And for example, we have developed long-life gripper shafts.

01:08.894 --> 01:12.217
I can show you here directly in the machine.

01:13.038 --> 01:19.690
So all the gripper shafts on impression cylinder and transfer drums,...

01:20.337 --> 01:23.303
...there is no lubrication needed...

01:23.505 --> 01:25.958
...because there are no greasing points anymore.

01:26.315 --> 01:31.378
So this is one of the first developments we have realized...

01:31.553 --> 01:35.098
...to reduce greasing points and minimize maintenance...

01:35.229 --> 01:36.788
...in terms of greasing the machine.

01:37.467 --> 01:40.969
Another advantage: there are no splashes of grease...

01:41.206 --> 01:43.535
...on printed sheets after over greasing...

01:43.941 --> 01:49.763
...or you also have to spend less time for the whole maintenance cycle per week,...

01:50.085 --> 01:55.591
...so our progressive metering technology with automatic grease supply.
