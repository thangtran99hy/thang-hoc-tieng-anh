WEBVTT

00:00.113 --> 00:01.620
That wasn't very nice, Nobi.

00:01.731 --> 00:02.509
I'm leaving!

00:03.673 --> 00:05.377
To think, his wedding is tomorrow.

00:05.617 --> 00:06.339
Time flies.

00:06.575 --> 00:09.102
Looks like our little Nobi's all grown up.

00:09.950 --> 00:11.946
I can't help but wonder where he's gone.

00:12.404 --> 00:15.307
I wish I could see my grandma one last time.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.669
If I could see your future wife,...

00:20.303 --> 00:22.769
...that would be enough to content my heart.

00:23.581 --> 00:25.650
So tell us why you ran away from the wedding.

00:25.789 --> 00:26.897
I mean, just look at me.

00:27.073 --> 00:28.143
What if I'm not good enough?

00:28.312 --> 00:30.908
What if I don't have what it takes to make Sue happy?

00:31.051 --> 00:31.647
I gotta go.

00:31.757 --> 00:32.612
There's no time.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.004
I'll be back as soon as I save us.

00:35.026 --> 00:36.696
There's no time to waste!

00:36.930 --> 00:39.041
I know Nobi is going to make it here no matter what.

00:39.357 --> 00:42.561
I am going to take back my future with Sue no matter what it takes.

00:42.631 --> 00:45.781
All of your moments with Big G, Sneech and Sue will be gone.

00:51.425 --> 00:53.431
You're fine just the way you are, Nobi.
