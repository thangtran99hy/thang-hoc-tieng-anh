00:00.094 --> 00:04.216
Scotland loved, respected and admired her.

00:04.757 --> 00:09.049
And by all accounts, Her Majesty was really happier...

00:09.248 --> 00:13.307
...than when she was here in Scotland at her beloved Balmoral.

00:13.707 --> 00:17.307
In fact, I have been privileged to observe personally.

00:17.863 --> 00:21.276
I hope it will be a source of comfort to her family...

00:21.473 --> 00:25.710
...that she spent her final days in a place that she loved so much.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.875
I had the opportunity to meet her before she passed...

00:28.975 --> 00:31.289
...and she was an incredibly gracious and decent woman.

00:32.077 --> 00:34.185
The thoughts and prayers of the American people...

00:34.670 --> 00:36.214
...are with the people of the United Kingdom...

00:36.306 --> 00:37.536
...and the Commonwealth and their grief.

00:37.982 --> 00:49.437
She was thoughtful, wise, curious, helpful, funny and so much more.

00:50.081 --> 00:51.906
I feel very similar emotions,...

00:51.982 --> 00:55.722
...both at the same time feeling a sense of deep sadness,...

00:55.785 --> 00:57.236
...but also deep gratitude.

00:57.581 --> 01:03.927
Here is a woman who gave her life utterly to the service of others.

01:04.147 --> 01:09.408
Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built.

01:10.314 --> 01:13.973
Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.

01:14.881 --> 01:19.147
Britain is the great country it is today because of her.

01:19.631 --> 01:24.607
Her life of faithful service will be remembered for centuries to come.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.136
From the moment the young princess became Queen,...

01:28.395 --> 01:32.791
...her Majesty's dedication to duty and service over self...

01:33.141 --> 01:35.385
...were the hallmarks of her reign.
