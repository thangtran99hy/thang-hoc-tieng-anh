00:00.050 --> 00:03.596
Nearly 50 million kids in the U.S. are headed back to class,...

00:03.767 --> 00:07.317
…and across the country, districts are approaching security differently.

00:07.709 --> 00:11.583
In Indiana, Jay County schools have gun safes on each campus,...

00:11.847 --> 00:14.783
…where trained staff have access with just a thumbprint.

00:15.278 --> 00:18.250
Clinton Public Schools in Mississippi added a fourth police officer.

00:18.545 --> 00:19.450
And in Las Vegas,...

00:19.687 --> 00:24.048
…El Dorado High School is set for a 26 million dollar security upgrade...

00:24.300 --> 00:27.729
…with cameras, single point entry, and perimeter fencing.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.706
I'm here at White Plains High School in New York...

00:30.833 --> 00:33.573
…for an exclusive look at their campus security system,...

00:33.649 --> 00:35.245
…and with me is John LaPlaca.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.156
He's a consultant who works with schools across the nation.

00:38.409 --> 00:39.448
Let's talk about the security here.

00:39.527 --> 00:41.499
What's the first thing a visitor would notice?

00:41.590 --> 00:42.615
So, as you approach the building,...

00:42.683 --> 00:45.309
…we're gonna have a single blocked point of entry for visitors.

00:45.619 --> 00:47.139
If they want to gain access to the building,...

00:47.218 --> 00:50.374
…the first step in the process would be they buzz in on the intercom system,...

00:50.450 --> 00:52.217
…which would be answered by security personnel inside.

00:53.685 --> 00:55.127
Hi there, it's John LaPlaca from Altaris.

00:55.206 --> 00:56.352
I'm here to visit the main office.

00:56.900 --> 00:57.943
So, I've announced myself,...

00:58.110 --> 01:00.311
…and the security person has now given us access to the building,...

01:00.378 --> 01:01.541
…has buzzed us into the vestibule.

01:01.835 --> 01:02.713
But that's not it.

01:02.865 --> 01:04.767
We're stopped by a second set of doors,...

01:04.842 --> 01:06.802
…where security scans our driver's license...

01:07.058 --> 01:11.619
...to cross-check against the sex offender registry and local banned persons lists.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.244
Okay, John. So, now we're inside the school.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.871
What other security measures are in place here?

01:15.982 --> 01:17.877
So, visible throughout the building, you'll see cameras.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.875
It also gives law enforcement the ability in an emergency situation...

01:21.074 --> 01:22.009
...to look at the cameras.

01:22.203 --> 01:23.579
What about the classrooms themselves?

01:23.663 --> 01:24.740
They have electronic locks,...

01:24.971 --> 01:27.883
…which will actually automatically lock in an emergency situation.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.711
Some of the best returns on investment for safety...

01:29.801 --> 01:31.371
…and security are things that cost nothing at all.

01:31.512 --> 01:35.381
Low-cost signs to help people provide 911 with their location...

01:35.523 --> 01:38.030
…and help responders outside find them.
