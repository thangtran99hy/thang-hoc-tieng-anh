00:00.779 --> 00:05.497
This morning, frustration is on the rise at airports across the country.

00:05.731 --> 00:08.108
I just don't understand how this is okay.

00:08.402 --> 00:11.349
With more than fifteen hundred flights canceled this weekend,...

00:11.523 --> 00:15.447
...and at least thirteen thousand delays from coast to coast.

00:15.543 --> 00:17.135
Hopefully, it doesn't get canceled again...

00:17.208 --> 00:20.500
...because I definitely need to get home and get stuff done.

00:21.644 --> 00:26.208
Nasty storms setting off a cascade of chaos for travelers.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.549
It's just really draining and frustrating.

00:29.655 --> 00:33.850
American and Southwest Airlines blaming summertime thunderstorms...

00:33.957 --> 00:37.203
...and weather-related challenges for the disruptions.

00:37.537 --> 00:41.850
But it's been a rocky summer for airlines dealing with crew and pilot shortages,...

00:42.079 --> 00:46.063
...reduced flight schedules, and a record surge in travelers.

00:46.263 --> 00:49.355
There aren't a lot of pilots sitting in reserve.

00:49.443 --> 00:52.859
There aren't a lot of planes sitting in reserve or crew or staff.

00:52.947 --> 00:54.951
And so when there's one cancellation,...

00:55.233 --> 00:58.015
...there's very little buffer or slack in the system.
