Welcome back.

00:00.805 --> 00:04.903
Today, a new groundbreaking study on the use of psychedelics to treat addiction.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.729
Doctors at NYU report significant improvements in patients...

00:08.826 --> 00:12.211
...who use the active ingredient in so-called magic mushrooms,...

00:12.339 --> 00:15.612
...along with psychotherapy to reduce alcohol abuse.

00:15.911 --> 00:19.605
NBC News and medical fellow, Dr. Akshay Syal, joins us now with more on this.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.570
So Doctor, this was the largest clinical study of its kind, the clinical trial.

00:23.645 --> 00:24.730
Walk us through what happened here.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.846
So Steven, really what they found was that, yes,...

00:26.908 --> 00:29.856
...this was the largest clinical trial looking at how psilocybin,...

00:29.935 --> 00:31.122
...which is found in magic mushrooms,...

00:31.197 --> 00:34.019
...can help cure alcohol or treat alcohol addiction.

00:34.433 --> 00:38.223
And so what they found off the top was that those who took the psilocybin...

00:38.287 --> 00:41.163
...saw an eighty percent reduction in the amount of heavy drinking days they had.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.449
And here's the really cool part,...

00:42.796 --> 00:44.534
...half of the people in the psilocybin group...

00:44.613 --> 00:47.419
...actually stayed sober for about eight months after their first dose.

00:47.807 --> 00:50.825
Wow. And how exactly does... what is the drug again?

00:50.918 --> 00:51.551
Psilocybin.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.831
Psilocybin. I'll work on that.

00:52.945 --> 00:54.088
How exactly does it work?

00:54.353 --> 00:56.914
So, the best idea or best guess right now...

00:56.990 --> 00:59.344
...is that it makes the brain more malleable to change.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.759
And so, you know, there's two components here:...

01:01.829 --> 01:03.621
...there's the psilocybin, and there's the therapy.

01:03.705 --> 01:04.655
You really need both...

01:04.908 --> 01:06.650
...because, just because you are more open to change,...

01:06.726 --> 01:07.996
...doesn't mean you're gonna change for the better.

01:08.379 --> 01:11.115
So, you really need that therapy to help guide you and help change you...

01:11.188 --> 01:13.341
...and work on your alcohol addiction.

01:13.963 --> 01:16.942
And I understand that you spoke to a patient who was part of this study.

01:17.202 --> 01:17.885
What did he have to say?

01:18.033 --> 01:19.295
Yeah, so the patient's name was John,...

01:19.367 --> 01:21.501
...and like a lot of people with alcohol use disorder,...

01:21.571 --> 01:22.917
...he'd been drinking for a long time.

01:22.985 --> 01:25.933
And so he enrolled in this trial, looking, because nothing else had really worked.

01:26.355 --> 01:30.195
And so basically what happened with him was he took a few doses,...

01:30.263 --> 01:34.969
...he had the hallucinogenic effects, and it cured him of his alcohol.

01:35.047 --> 01:38.793
He said when he sees alcohol now, he no longer has a desire to drink.

01:39.078 --> 01:39.901
Here's what he had to say.

01:42.129 --> 01:44.783
This worked almost like an antibiotic for me.

01:45.089 --> 01:50.679
Where I was sick with a disease or a disorder, I went into this clinical trial,...

01:50.908 --> 01:52.221
...and this surpassed that.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.513
This took away,...

01:53.587 --> 01:58.399
..this eliminated all my cravings to the point where it cured my alcoholism.
