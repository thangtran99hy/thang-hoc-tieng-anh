Throughout her life, Her Majesty the Queen, my beloved mother...

00:06.615 --> 00:11.135
...was an inspiration and example to me and to all my family,...

00:11.941 --> 00:15.001
...and we owe her the most heartfelt debt...

00:15.504 --> 00:18.212
...any family could owe to their mother...

00:18.671 --> 00:25.157
...for her love, affection, guidance, understanding and example.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.641
Queen Elizabeth was a life well lived,....

00:30.506 --> 00:36.911
...a promise with destiny kept, and she is mourned most deeply in her passing.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.919
That promise of lifelong service...

00:41.254 --> 00:43.836
...I renew to you all today,...

00:44.669 --> 00:49.144
...freedoms and responsibilities of our unique history...

00:49.650 --> 00:52.311
...and our system of parliamentary government.

00:54.697 --> 00:58.873
As the Queen herself did with such unswerving devotion,...

00:59.643 --> 01:02.602
...I, too, now solemnly pledge myself...

01:03.310 --> 01:06.244
...throughout the remaining time God grants me...

01:06.797 --> 01:11.663
...to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation.

01:12.701 --> 01:15.244
In a little over a week's time,...

01:15.707 --> 01:19.858
...we will come together as a nation, as a Commonwealth,...

01:20.331 --> 01:22.578
...and indeed a global community,...

01:23.570 --> 01:26.067
...to lay my beloved mother to rest.

01:27.353 --> 01:34.741
In our sorrow, let us remember and draw strength from the light of her example.

01:37.117 --> 01:39.037
On behalf of all my family,...

01:39.549 --> 01:44.599
...I can only offer the most sincere and heartfelt thanks...

01:45.013 --> 01:47.769
...for your condolences and support.

01:48.919 --> 01:52.854
They mean more to me than I can ever possibly express.
