Tom Brady, the ageless quarterback.

00:02.771 --> 00:04.939
I was away from the game for almost two years.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.595
He didn't make two months.

00:08.266 --> 00:09.495
But you know what that tells me?

00:09.973 --> 00:11.067
How much he wants it.

00:11.829 --> 00:12.805
How much he needs it.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.574
Especially against them Cowboys,...

00:16.069 --> 00:17.666
...who have never beaten him.

00:17.932 --> 00:18.860
We'll see y'all in the game, trust me.

00:18.967 --> 00:21.945
Because greatness like this doesn't come along that often.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.267
He's back.

00:23.431 --> 00:25.008
Let's go!
