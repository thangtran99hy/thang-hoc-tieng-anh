00:01.117 --> 00:01.587
Do you live here?

00:01.886 --> 00:02.086
Yeah.

00:02.705 --> 00:04.028
Okay, we're really lost.

00:04.093 --> 00:04.760
Where are you trying to go?

00:04.925 --> 00:06.716
Museum, which I think is that way.

00:06.963 --> 00:07.586
Am I right?

00:07.653 --> 00:08.393
Yeah, it's definitely that way.

00:08.606 --> 00:08.719
Okay.

00:09.291 --> 00:09.940
Let me see here.

00:10.121 --> 00:11.296
Alright, first of all, you're upside down.

00:11.515 --> 00:11.601
Okay.

00:12.168 --> 00:13.546
Okay, so yeah, we're way down here.

00:13.751 --> 00:13.887
All right.

00:13.987 --> 00:14.743
You want to be up here.

00:15.000 --> 00:15.511
It's that way?

00:15.685 --> 00:15.919
Right.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.499
So you're going to head five blocks north.

00:17.659 --> 00:17.880
Right.

00:17.953 --> 00:18.242
Right.

00:18.346 --> 00:19.771
When you get to Joey's Pizza, make a right.

00:21.427 --> 00:22.923
Then you're gonna go three blocks east.

00:23.321 --> 00:23.773
Okay.

00:23.928 --> 00:25.549
There's a hot dog cart on this corner.

00:25.606 --> 00:26.983
You're going to make a left of that hot dog cart...

00:27.244 --> 00:29.069
...and you're going to go three blocks past this jazz club,...

00:29.140 --> 00:29.886
...and it's going to be right in front of you.

00:30.491 --> 00:30.971
Okay, great.

00:31.059 --> 00:33.048
Okay, so I knew I was right about this.

00:33.128 --> 00:35.461
So it's five, three, and three.

00:35.609 --> 00:35.687
Yeah.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.333
Great.

00:36.459 --> 00:37.761
Thank you very much.

00:37.857 --> 00:39.014
Oh, wait, let me get a picture of you guys.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.035
Thank you so much.
