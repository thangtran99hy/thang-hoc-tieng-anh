Serena Williams to serve.

00:02.101 --> 00:04.369
When the world writes her down in history,...

00:04.757 --> 00:06.547
...we'll begin where she started:...

00:07.253 --> 00:08.170
...at love.

00:10.169 --> 00:15.421
No points, zero score, just love.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.761
It's a love that will remember through the generations,...

00:21.163 --> 00:23.592
...a love that started a movement,...

00:23.859 --> 00:29.583
...a movement to always love exactly who you are and who you can be.

00:29.957 --> 00:32.471
To be so in love with your identity...

00:32.843 --> 00:36.432
...that your very essence cannot be contained.

00:36.707 --> 00:41.256
To love the sound of your own voice and the way you move.

00:43.573 --> 00:49.201
To feel like a queen unapologetically with a crown indefinitely.

00:51.208 --> 00:56.465
To cherish every muscle and every curve your body exhibits.

00:58.568 --> 01:03.295
A movement to always love being a proud black woman.

01:03.754 --> 01:04.747
A parent.

01:05.518 --> 01:06.447
A dreamer.

01:07.953 --> 01:08.643
A leader.

01:08.799 --> 01:09.921
Yes, ladies, it can be done.

01:10.316 --> 01:12.810
To love being one of a kind.

01:13.269 --> 01:16.067
To always love being you.

01:19.419 --> 01:20.565
The whole you.

01:22.612 --> 01:23.772
The real you.

01:25.059 --> 01:30.512
You, you, you, to always love you.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.862
So when we write her down in history,...

01:34.237 --> 01:35.423
...no matter who you are,...

01:35.930 --> 01:37.256
...no matter where you are,...

01:37.620 --> 01:40.343
...we'll remember what she has shown us:...

01:42.255 --> 01:46.331
...a movement to love you.
