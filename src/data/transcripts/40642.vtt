Well here in Singapore, the country's Prime Minister has said...

00:02.433 --> 00:04.865
...Singapore will end its ban on sex between men..

00:04.951 --> 00:07.973
...but will take steps to defend the institution of marriage...

00:08.033 --> 00:10.211
...as a union between a man and a woman.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.047
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said...

00:12.147 --> 00:15.705
...Singaporean society was becoming more accepting of gay people,...

00:16.083 --> 00:18.265
...and the British colonial era law was out of date,...

00:18.700 --> 00:21.385
...and the legal ban on sex between men, while not enforced,...

00:21.500 --> 00:24.083
...has long been criticized by LGBT activists,...

00:24.167 --> 00:27.962
...although many more conservative citizens still support it.

00:30.049 --> 00:36.936
The government will repeal Section 377a and decriminalize sex between men.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.763
I believe this is the right thing to do...

00:41.500 --> 00:46.110
...and something that most Singaporeans will now accept.

00:47.233 --> 00:51.012
That was the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong speaking at the National Day Rally.

00:51.081 --> 00:53.797
And with me is our Asia digital reporter Tessa Wong,...

00:53.900 --> 00:58.993
...who's been following and reporting on this issue for years in Singapore.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.020
It's great to get you on the program, Tessa.

01:01.367 --> 01:02.531
I think it's fair to say, isn't it,...

01:02.640 --> 01:05.395
...that there's been huge joy in the wake of this decision,...

01:05.486 --> 01:09.515
...but at the same time, criticism that effectively a red line...

01:09.591 --> 01:11.683
...has been drawn when it comes to gay marriage.

01:13.088 --> 01:13.917
That's right, Karishma.

01:13.993 --> 01:17.518
So, when the news broke last night, it was met with immediate joy,...

01:17.938 --> 01:21.775
...and, you know, one LGBT activist that I interviewed for my story actually told me,...

01:21.973 --> 01:24.115
"I'm ecstatic, you know. I'm at a loss for words."

01:24.465 --> 01:27.757
And you know, there were pictures of people celebrating at parties,...

01:27.836 --> 01:32.177
...waving the LGBT flag at private viewing parties of the speech last night.

01:32.506 --> 01:36.179
But at the same time, you know, the move has also been met with some caution.

01:36.754 --> 01:38.969
Effectively, what the Singapore government has done...

01:39.233 --> 01:42.035
...is  that they've made it a lot harder to legalize gay marriage.

01:42.109 --> 01:44.222
They have put in constitutional protections...

01:44.300 --> 01:47.983
...for the definition of marriage as one is between a man and a woman.
