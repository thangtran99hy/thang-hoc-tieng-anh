00:00.050 --> 00:01.725
For the first time in four years,...

00:01.816 --> 00:06.383
…the U.S. and South Korea will revive their live action military drills.

00:06.455 --> 00:10.503
This is heightening their preparedness as the North Korean nuclear threat worsens...

00:10.731 --> 00:13.608
...and China steps up its presence around Taiwan.

00:13.947 --> 00:20.064
But there's concern that North Korea could use the drills as a pretext to retaliate.

00:20.945 --> 00:27.067
Let's just take you now to Jean Mackenzie, our correspondent in South Korea...

00:27.155 --> 00:29.924
…who was given rare access to the joint operations center...

00:30.011 --> 00:31.263
…from where the war games are run.

00:33.462 --> 00:38.404
Deep underground, an American and a South Korean colonel watch North Korea.

00:38.613 --> 00:41.133
I'm learning, but it's difficult to get it right.

00:41.947 --> 00:44.176
In this classified bunker outside Seoul,...

00:44.549 --> 00:48.982
…the two militaries work together to defend against a North Korean attack.

00:49.601 --> 00:51.195
This is the only place in Korea...

00:51.291 --> 00:55.140
…where U.S. forces and South Korean forces sit side by side.

00:55.467 --> 00:57.317
And using all this information,...

00:57.394 --> 01:01.979
…they can detect almost immediately if North Korea launches a weapon.

01:02.226 --> 01:05.148
Between his great English and my terrible Korean,...

01:05.221 --> 01:07.260
...we can usually muddle through a lot of different things...

01:07.486 --> 01:08.997
…and get to a decision quickly.
