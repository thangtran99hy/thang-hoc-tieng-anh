00:02.379 --> 00:06.883
More than 20,000 species of debris are tracked as they orbit Earth.

00:07.719 --> 00:12.523
However, most of this debris is too small for ground-based sensors to track.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.115
Mounted on the exterior of the International Space Station,...

00:19.572 --> 00:25.040
...the Space Debris Sensor (SDS) collects data on smaller orbital debris.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.201
The SDS consists of three layers.

00:28.667 --> 00:32.949
The first two layers are identical and incorporate acoustic sensors.

00:33.761 --> 00:38.885
These measure the exact time and location of a debris hit and the velocity vector.

00:39.432 --> 00:44.825
The first layer has a resistive grid, which gives an indication of debris size.

00:45.695 --> 00:50.727
The last layer helps determine the impact energy and density of the particle.

00:55.322 --> 01:00.319
The data obtained will help estimate the population of debris smaller than 1 mm,...

01:00.979 --> 01:03.414
...and allow a new set of sensors to be developed...

01:03.845 --> 01:07.977
...and placed in the midst of the debris field above station orbit.

01:10.007 --> 01:14.566
This will help improve the debris detection and characterization technology...

01:15.073 --> 01:19.270
...necessary to protect satellites and human space flight missions.
