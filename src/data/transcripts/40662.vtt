00:00.128 --> 00:01.522
There were moments all day long,...

00:02.780 --> 00:04.440
...all day long,...

00:05.009 --> 00:07.667
...just like that five-second moment in bed...

00:08.993 --> 00:12.663
...where I knew knowledge, what I should do,...

00:14.005 --> 00:16.204
...and if I didn't move within five seconds,...

00:17.409 --> 00:19.423
...my brain would step in and talk me out of it.

00:20.427 --> 00:22.437
Every human being has a five-second window.

00:22.532 --> 00:24.626
It might even be shorter for you.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.225
You have about a five-second window...

00:27.327 --> 00:31.009
...in which you can move from idea to action...

00:31.093 --> 00:33.116
...before your brain kicks into full gear...

00:33.984 --> 00:37.046
...and sabotages any change in behavior.

00:37.768 --> 00:40.119
Because remember, your brain is wired to stop you...

00:40.237 --> 00:42.991
...from doing things that are uncomfortable or uncertain or scary.

00:44.025 --> 00:47.921
It's your job to learn how to move from those ideas...

00:47.985 --> 00:49.152
...that could change everything...

00:50.527 --> 00:53.333
...into acting on them in the smallest moment.
