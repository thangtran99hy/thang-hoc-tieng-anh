00:00.352 --> 00:01.755
When the pandemic hit,...

00:01.912 --> 00:05.601
...businesses anticipated that the COVID recession was coming.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.445
They thought that demand was going to drop.

00:08.367 --> 00:09.750
But something funny happened.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.094
The opposite of what all of these businesses...

00:13.205 --> 00:14.957
...and economists predicted happened.

00:15.157 --> 00:16.660
Demand exploded.

00:17.089 --> 00:18.542
People bought things like crazy,...

00:18.854 --> 00:21.226
...and now supply chains are choking on that record demand.

00:22.127 --> 00:24.543
Everyone has had the experience of not being able to get something,...

00:24.925 --> 00:28.433
...and everyone has had the experience of paying more for something.

00:29.084 --> 00:31.713
Prior to the pandemic, most of us just took it for granted that...

00:31.960 --> 00:34.023
...we could get things ever faster.

00:34.349 --> 00:37.583
E-commerce made it seem like everything was right at our doorstep,...

00:38.486 --> 00:43.184
...but that obscures what was a 14,000-mile journey halfway around the world.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.241
It took months.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.995
And when you add up all the automation, all the algorithms,...

00:48.457 --> 00:51.221
...all of the hundreds of people who had to touch those goods...

00:51.305 --> 00:52.779
...or transport them in some way,...

00:53.009 --> 00:56.249
...it's in total, one of the most complicated endeavors...

00:56.401 --> 00:58.299
...that human beings ever engage in,...

00:58.485 --> 01:01.585
...and yet, it happens millions of times per day...

01:02.158 --> 01:03.526
...and we take it for granted...

01:03.873 --> 01:05.707
....because all of that has been rolled...

01:05.825 --> 01:09.903
...behind this ultimate convenience of just one click e-commerce shopping.

01:11.335 --> 01:14.113
But the pandemic showed us just how unsustainable...

01:14.218 --> 01:16.659
...and unrealistic that expectation is.
