What kind of high is it when you're on stage...

00:04.469 --> 00:08.025
...and you look out and all you see are people?

00:09.714 --> 00:12.335
I think it's like, you know, how people say...

00:12.409 --> 00:14.815
...after you go on a stage...

00:14.925 --> 00:18.225
...where you feel like you really interacted with the crowd?

00:19.546 --> 00:22.223
It lasts for a long time and it's really addictive.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.737
I totally experienced that this time.

00:24.823 --> 00:27.351
So after the show, we drove back to LA...

00:27.431 --> 00:29.635
...and we were at our hotel room, and I remembered...

00:29.695 --> 00:33.718
...I just had to keep replaying it over in my head like again and again,...

00:33.801 --> 00:34.215
...and it was like...

00:34.629 --> 00:40.173
...that was the best feeling I've ever felt in my 22 years of existence.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.327
It's really really surreal.

00:42.467 --> 00:46.691
It's so life-changing.

00:46.808 --> 00:48.773
I love the whole experience.

00:48.963 --> 00:51.497
It's so beautiful and everybody is just amazing.

00:51.602 --> 00:53.107
Everyone in the crowd.
