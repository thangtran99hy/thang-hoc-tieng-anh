It's hard to compete with this kind of scenery in San Francisco,...

00:04.263 --> 00:08.781
…but Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, hopes riders will also appreciate...

00:08.860 --> 00:10.607
…the view inside the car.

00:10.893 --> 00:14.934
One of 26,000 electric vehicles now on Uber's platform.

00:15.258 --> 00:17.351
So, it turned out to be a great inspiration...

00:17.442 --> 00:20.678
…both for riders but especially drivers to go out and go electric.

00:21.269 --> 00:26.122
Uber has quadrupled its EV fleet in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in the past year...

00:26.451 --> 00:29.779
…and plans to double it to 50,000 next year.

00:30.313 --> 00:33.669
All part of its new product called Comfort Electric.

00:34.304 --> 00:39.038
It's a Tesla, a PoleStar, a Ford Mach-E, these are great cars.

00:39.147 --> 00:43.030
What is kind of the end goal of putting so many more EVs on your platform?

00:43.376 --> 00:50.789
By 2030, we have a target to be fully electric in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.921
By 2030, will a driver who is driving a gas powered vehicle...

00:55.119 --> 00:56.267
...be allowed on your platform?

00:57.125 --> 00:59.843
No. If we're doing our job, we're going to be all electric.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.365
In the U.S., transportation is the single largest source...

01:05.457 --> 01:07.835
...of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.743
Beautiful, we have the Uber logo, I love it.

01:11.005 --> 01:13.386
Uber is trying to slash its carbon footprint...

01:13.478 --> 01:14.027
Hello.

01:14.167 --> 01:15.017
How's it going?

01:15.161 --> 01:18.511
...by incentivizing its drivers to switch to EVs.

01:18.691 --> 01:20.087
But these are not cheap.

01:20.409 --> 01:21.486
No, they're not cheap.

01:21.805 --> 01:25.379
We need electric vehicles, and that cost 20, 30,000 dollars...

01:25.743 --> 01:28.020
…versus 50 to 60,000 dollars.

01:28.357 --> 01:31.239
Uber says it's going to spend 800 million dollars...

01:31.325 --> 01:33.592
...to offset some costs for its drivers.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.201
It's paying them an extra dollar for every EV trip they make...

01:37.431 --> 01:39.260
…and providing discounts on charging.

01:39.723 --> 01:43.497
Uber is partnering with Hertz, where drivers can now rent Teslas...

01:43.595 --> 01:45.743
…on a weekly or monthly basis.
