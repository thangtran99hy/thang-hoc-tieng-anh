California is suing Amazon, accusing the world's largest retailer...

00:04.129 --> 00:06.425
...of alleged antitrust law violations.

00:06.547 --> 00:09.850
That's right, the state's attorney general claims the company's practices...

00:09.935 --> 00:13.857
...stifle competitors while driving up online prices.

00:14.210 --> 00:18.897
Amazon serves roughly 25 million people in California alone.

00:19.176 --> 00:22.611
According to the 2020 census, California's total population...

00:22.858 --> 00:25.431
...is just over 39 million people.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.891
And while the lawsuit is restricted to the Golden State,...

00:29.163 --> 00:32.427
...it could have significant implications nationwide.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.640
Amazon claims the California attorney general, quote,...

00:35.853 --> 00:37.558
"...has it exactly backward."

00:37.832 --> 00:39.912
The company's statement goes on to say,...

00:39.987 --> 00:44.362
..."The relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature higher prices..."

00:44.433 --> 00:49.387
"...to customers, oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law."

00:49.900 --> 00:52.383
So, let's bring in California's attorney general, Robert Bonta,...

00:52.469 --> 00:53.993
...now for more on all of this.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.117
Attorney General Bonta, welcome.

00:56.187 --> 00:57.983
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:58.061 --> 01:01.365
So, first off, we want to get your response to Amazon's statement there...

01:01.454 --> 01:03.781
...saying that you have the situation backwards...

01:03.847 --> 01:07.241
...that this lawsuit will only drive up prices on its platform...

01:07.324 --> 01:09.090
...and ultimately hurt consumers.

01:11.135 --> 01:13.823
Unfortunately, they have it exactly backwards...

01:13.900 --> 01:16.743
...and they maintain that position at their own peril.

01:16.827 --> 01:22.988
We have a very detailed complaint based on two and a half years of investigation...

01:23.060 --> 01:25.057
...and document gathering and interviews...

01:25.139 --> 01:29.405
...with businesses and vendors that do business with Amazon.

01:29.493 --> 01:34.270
We interviewed Amazon's own employees to build this case.

01:34.349 --> 01:37.725
And what is clear from all that evidence is that...

01:38.046 --> 01:41.092
...Amazon has artificially inflated prices.

01:41.523 --> 01:48.169
And the remedies and the solutions that we seek through this investigation...

01:48.233 --> 01:50.775
...and through this lawsuit will lower prices...

01:50.869 --> 01:51.953
...for consumers who deserve it.

01:52.050 --> 01:54.960
Who are paying artificially high prices for everything...

01:55.038 --> 01:56.907
...ranging from groceries and healthcare items,...

01:57.003 --> 01:59.401
...to diapers and school supplies.

01:59.627 --> 02:03.503
They've been paying artificially inflated prices for over a decade...

02:03.875 --> 02:06.977
...and it needs to stop, and that's why we're telling Amazon...

02:07.055 --> 02:07.815
...we'll see you in court.
