00:00.050 --> 00:02.399
The stunning announcement from the founder of Patagonia...

00:02.631 --> 00:07.019
…sharing that he's giving away the three billion dollar company...

00:07.101 --> 00:08.464
...to help fight climate change.

00:08.941 --> 00:12.096
Our chief business correspondent, Rebecca Jarvis, is here with that.

00:12.191 --> 00:13.069
Good morning, Rebecca.

00:13.164 --> 00:14.069
Good morning to you, Robin.

00:14.142 --> 00:17.101
And it's extraordinary, not only because of what he's doing,...

00:17.185 --> 00:18.452
…but how he's doing it.

00:18.543 --> 00:21.625
Most billionaires donate tiny slivers of their wealth...

00:21.716 --> 00:22.910
…while they're still living.

00:23.137 --> 00:25.095
But not the founder of Patagonia.

00:25.195 --> 00:28.381
He says his two adult children don't want the money...

00:28.476 --> 00:30.276
...and he and his wife don't need it.

00:30.413 --> 00:33.787
So, they're giving away the three billion dollar company he founded...

00:34.032 --> 00:35.128
…half a century ago.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.137
With their signature jackets, vests, and pullovers,...

00:39.264 --> 00:43.053
...Patagonia has become one of the biggest apparel brands in the world.

00:43.233 --> 00:46.589
The activewear company worth three billion dollars.

00:46.922 --> 00:52.812
But this morning, Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, making a landmark decision...

00:52.921 --> 00:55.359
...to give away all of his company's profits,...

00:55.567 --> 00:59.908
…estimated at 100 million dollars a year to help Mother Earth.

01:00.233 --> 01:04.586
Not a lot of people understand how serious we are about saving this planet.

01:05.654 --> 01:06.751
I'm dead serious.

01:07.169 --> 01:12.181
Chouinard deciding to transfer ownership to a trust in a non-profit organization...

01:12.264 --> 01:14.335
…dedicated to combating climate change...

01:14.399 --> 01:17.635
and protecting undeveloped land all around the world.

01:17.805 --> 01:22.044
The job of these non-profits is to invest this money...

01:22.233 --> 01:27.461
…into environmentally friendly initiatives and into political candidates.

01:27.585 --> 01:31.959
Chouinard saying, "Earth is now our only shareholder."

01:32.121 --> 01:36.504
Even those we call generous and think of as big philanthropists...

01:37.131 --> 01:39.373
…they don't give away a huge fraction of their wealth.

01:39.504 --> 01:41.106
So, this is very different.

01:41.653 --> 01:45.461
This is much more dramatic than we usually see in the world of philanthropy.

01:45.692 --> 01:49.517
The 83 year old founder saying, what Patagonia has been doing,...

01:49.776 --> 01:52.941
…donating one percent of their sales to climate change efforts,...

01:53.107 --> 01:56.733
…wasn't enough and we needed to find a way to put more money...

01:56.808 --> 02:00.911
…into fighting the crisis while keeping the company's values intact.
