00:00.079 --> 00:03.269
Look, it's been a wonderful day.

00:03.353 --> 00:05.703
I told the guys I'm happy, I'm not sad.

00:06.060 --> 00:09.081
So, it feels great to be here.

00:15.404 --> 00:20.388
And I enjoyed tying my shoes one more time...

00:20.485 --> 00:22.797
...and everything was the last time.

00:22.977 --> 00:23.904
It is amazing.

00:24.017 --> 00:24.787
It really is.

00:31.159 --> 00:33.667
I didn't want it to feel lonely out there.

00:34.355 --> 00:36.717
I felt lonely for a second when they told me to go out...

00:36.863 --> 00:38.745
...or you wanted me to come out one more time.

00:39.129 --> 00:39.894
And it felt great.

00:40.037 --> 00:42.521
But to be saying goodbye in the team,...

00:42.791 --> 00:44.651
...I always felt I was a team player at heart.

00:45.229 --> 00:47.847
Singles doesn't really do that a whole lot,...

00:47.951 --> 00:52.120
...but I've had a team that traveled with me around the world...

00:52.189 --> 00:53.062
...and it's been amazing with them.

00:53.139 --> 00:56.298
So, thanks to everybody who made it work for so many years.

00:56.705 --> 00:57.742
So, it's been a perfect journey.

00:57.820 --> 00:58.931
I would do it all over again.

01:20.237 --> 01:20.778
It's been great.

01:20.858 --> 01:21.775
It's been so much fun.

01:21.968 --> 01:22.691
It's been amazing.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.321
Thank you, everybody.

01:25.317 --> 01:30.050
I've had so many people cheer me on and you guys here tonight means the world.
