Our office is awesome,...

00:02.281 --> 00:03.954
...but not everyone is there every day.

00:04.187 --> 00:07.652
Some people might never be there.

00:08.106 --> 00:10.293
And when you're not at the office, it can feel like you're missing out...

00:10.734 --> 00:13.427
...on the energy and spontaneous conversations.

00:13.698 --> 00:14.467
Check this out.

00:18.007 --> 00:20.396
So how do we work together like we're all at the office?

00:20.552 --> 00:21.673
How do you guys feel about the website?

00:21.760 --> 00:22.665
It looks pretty good.

00:23.488 --> 00:25.325
Tandem spaces, that's how.

00:25.591 --> 00:26.927
Oh, hey there.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.240
Love that mug.

00:28.844 --> 00:30.034
Thank you, I made it actually.

00:30.389 --> 00:31.598
Really into pottery.

00:32.193 --> 00:34.707
Think of Tandem spaces like a window into the office,...

00:34.776 --> 00:37.541
...an open window where your remote team could work,...

00:37.675 --> 00:40.233
...hang out and join in just like they're there.

00:41.029 --> 00:42.519
Hey, let me show you this mock-up.

00:43.513 --> 00:44.863
Oh, let me see.

00:45.347 --> 00:48.219
We're thinking that this part can be completely interactive.

00:48.497 --> 00:49.633
Hey, I love that.

00:50.205 --> 00:52.669
See, it could rotate like this.

00:54.795 --> 00:58.104
Hey, just jumping in to say, number one, I think that's awesome,...

00:58.181 --> 01:00.593
...and two, we can definitely pull that off.

01:00.883 --> 01:01.663
I'll let the team know.

01:01.878 --> 01:02.806
I got you.

01:02.971 --> 01:04.657
They're right here.

01:05.943 --> 01:06.693
Hey, what's up?

01:06.940 --> 01:10.755
Just talked to the design team and check this out.

01:11.299 --> 01:12.278
That looks awesome.

01:12.593 --> 01:13.612
Can we add layers to it too?

01:13.801 --> 01:16.241
Yeah, we can add labels.

01:17.007 --> 01:20.209
With Tandem spaces, I can move around and find my team.

01:20.883 --> 01:23.307
And I could join a meeting in the conference room,...

01:23.475 --> 01:25.574
...brainstorm with my team over here...

01:25.913 --> 01:29.038
...and see Mike, who's about to drop his new mug on the ground.

01:29.238 --> 01:29.550
Mike!

01:29.667 --> 01:30.061
Mike!

01:31.091 --> 01:31.667
Thank you.

01:33.033 --> 01:35.854
With Tandem spaces, we can work like we're in the same room...

01:36.418 --> 01:37.346
...no matter where we are.
