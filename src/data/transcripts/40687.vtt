Akie Abe carrying the ashes of her husband.

00:06.785 --> 00:08.226
A state funeral in Japan...

00:08.321 --> 00:11.477
...is normally reserved for members of the imperial family.

00:11.745 --> 00:15.139
The assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in July...

00:15.230 --> 00:17.708
...has made this one of the few exceptions.

00:21.669 --> 00:24.576
World leaders gathered to attend the solemn service.

00:24.907 --> 00:27.947
Australia's delegation is notably high-profile,...

00:28.153 --> 00:29.764
...with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese...

00:29.825 --> 00:32.119
...bringing three of his predecessors.

00:32.515 --> 00:35.515
What that says is how important the relationship...

00:35.652 --> 00:37.572
...between Australia and Japan is.

00:40.178 --> 00:43.089
But the decision to hold a state funeral has angered many.

00:45.591 --> 00:48.833
Protesters today gathered as they have done in the past weeks.

00:49.370 --> 00:52.544
They're opposed to the 17-million-dollar tax-funded service...

00:52.636 --> 00:56.037
...for the conservative PM and Abe's support for a religious group...

00:56.184 --> 00:58.346
...renowned for fleecing money from its members,...

00:58.465 --> 01:00.739
...including from the assassin's family.

01:02.293 --> 01:05.017
He was like a poster boy for the Unification Church.

01:05.245 --> 01:07.061
Many people suffered because of that.

01:07.635 --> 01:12.005
Japan was united in shock when Shinzo Abe was gunned down,...

01:12.311 --> 01:16.668
...but now, as you can see, the nation is divided over his legacy.

01:16.891 --> 01:20.459
Shinzo Abe may have been the longest-serving prime minister,...

01:20.661 --> 01:24.034
...but he never commanded strong support here at home.

01:24.324 --> 01:27.034
Now, those tensions are on full display.

01:27.679 --> 01:30.863
Earlier, Prime Minister Albanese met with his Japanese counterpart,...

01:30.959 --> 01:34.326
...Fumio Kishida, to show his respects to the former leader.

01:35.295 --> 01:39.669
So, too, did the former PMs. John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.

01:39.851 --> 01:42.808
He had a genuinely warm personality...

01:42.881 --> 01:47.478
...that went well beyond the formalities of politics.

01:48.097 --> 01:51.698
A life cut short by a brutal crime edged into history.

01:51.970 --> 01:53.804
