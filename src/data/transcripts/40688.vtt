00:01.678 --> 00:02.452
Howdy!

00:02.626 --> 00:04.021
We're Squid Research Lab,...

00:04.270 --> 00:06.786
...your well-researched source for everything Splatoon.

00:06.945 --> 00:08.166
So, what is Splatoon?

00:08.375 --> 00:12.520
Let's start with this suspicious pool of ink that also hides a squid.

00:18.089 --> 00:19.918
It's also kind of a humanoid.

00:23.127 --> 00:26.023
Go into swim form to swim and sneak through ink,...

00:26.200 --> 00:29.295
...then go from squid to kid and ink everything.

00:29.667 --> 00:30.820
You're a kid, you're a squid.

00:30.968 --> 00:32.274
You swim ink, you shoot ink.

00:32.497 --> 00:35.127
Thems the basics of Splatoon.

00:36.976 --> 00:39.675
Now, let's dive a little deeper, shall we?

00:41.317 --> 00:45.583
Inklings have two legs, but bipedals can only go so fast.

00:46.841 --> 00:51.075
So accelerate by letting those tentacles do the work in swim mode.

00:51.239 --> 00:54.287
Leap out of ink and use momentum to get even more air.

00:57.573 --> 01:01.418
Walls are also traversable as long as they are inked.

01:01.851 --> 01:03.415
Verticality!

01:04.333 --> 01:08.115
Use gyroscopic motion controls to aim your ink.

01:11.502 --> 01:14.233
From there, it's essentially like using a water gun.

01:14.941 --> 01:15.757
Aim, shoot.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.562
Repeat.

01:18.783 --> 01:21.658
You are now a certified squid movement specialist.
