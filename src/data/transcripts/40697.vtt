Shannon Craft visited this Chicago area food pantry...

00:04.757 --> 00:06.283
...for the first time last month,...

00:06.929 --> 00:09.277
...collecting a bag of groceries for her family.

00:09.829 --> 00:12.331
She'd used federal food stamps to buy groceries,...

00:12.893 --> 00:16.498
...but rising prices over the summer meant that assistance fell short.

00:16.918 --> 00:18.493
That's why she came here.

00:18.980 --> 00:20.304
Inflation is through the roof.

00:20.565 --> 00:25.025
You got to decide between medication and food.

00:25.527 --> 00:26.571
She's not alone.

00:27.185 --> 00:31.932
Nourishing Hope has seen a 40% increase in visitors this year so far.

00:32.746 --> 00:36.047
Rising hunger is a problem for U.S. president Joe Biden.

00:36.867 --> 00:40.890
He's set to host the first White House summit on hunger in 50 years...

00:41.327 --> 00:44.879
...and is pledging to eliminate hunger in the U.S. by 2030.
