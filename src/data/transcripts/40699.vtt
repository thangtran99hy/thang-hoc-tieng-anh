00:00.603 --> 00:02.067
My name is Martin Schoeller.

00:02.259 --> 00:04.026
I'm a photographer and artist.

00:05.327 --> 00:08.383
I work a lot for magazines photographing well-known people.

00:10.167 --> 00:14.438
I also do personal projects that are close to my heart, such as this one.

00:15.033 --> 00:17.059
On January 1st, 2021,...

00:17.322 --> 00:21.965
...a new rule went into effect called the Hospital Price Transparency rule.

00:22.307 --> 00:25.929
This bipartisan rule requires every hospital in the United States...

00:26.011 --> 00:28.367
...to provide clear and accessible pricing...

00:28.744 --> 00:32.253
...about the items and services they provide to their patients.

00:33.071 --> 00:36.751
Despite the rule, 86 percent of hospitals...

00:36.863 --> 00:40.018
...are still not complying with the government-issued requirements.

00:40.233 --> 00:43.893
Whether it's through surprise bills or straight up price gouging,...

00:44.553 --> 00:47.256
...many of these patients are getting financially destroyed.

00:47.676 --> 00:52.783
I remember opening up that first bill and thinking, "it was just complete shock."

00:53.021 --> 00:56.551
And I was so hurt because everybody seemed so kind and so nice.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.717
And then, suddenly, you're hit with this bill.

00:59.780 --> 01:02.198
And I just thought, "there has to be a better way."

01:03.535 --> 01:06.109
Without hospitals providing prices up front,...

01:06.212 --> 01:09.717
...there is no opportunity for patients to compare prices...

01:09.833 --> 01:13.383
...or to make any informed financial decisions about their care.

01:13.789 --> 01:15.671
And without prices being published,...

01:16.161 --> 01:19.282
...there will never be price competition between hospitals.

01:19.599 --> 01:21.853
They can basically charge patients whatever they want.

01:25.459 --> 01:30.783
I have had issues with severe asthma the last at least 10 years.

01:30.858 --> 01:36.917
And then last year, I had Covid, which sort of sent everything into a downward spiral.

01:37.767 --> 01:40.075
I was in the hospital at least 10 times...

01:40.149 --> 01:44.253
...maybe more. Like, a lot. Too much.

01:44.382 --> 01:48.000
I've been a patient since 1989.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.780
Basically, I'm a woman living with HIV.

01:50.883 --> 01:53.275
I had a lot of abdominal surgeries.

01:53.425 --> 01:54.335
I think it was 17.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.537
Now it's 21, I think.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.366
21 surgeries.

01:57.528 --> 02:00.291
They would just say, "Okay, well now you need to see a cardiologist."

02:00.367 --> 02:01.816
"Now, you need to see a neurologist."

02:01.885 --> 02:04.905
Did they ever tell you beforehand how much things would cost?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.144
Of course not. No.
