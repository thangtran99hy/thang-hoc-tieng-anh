As Roger Federer prepares to retire,..

00:02.567 --> 00:06.405
…unlike some,  the tennis champ tells Savannah Guthrie exclusively,...

00:06.651 --> 00:08.959
…he's not looking for a do-over.

00:09.047 --> 00:10.953
You know, unretiring is a thing now.

00:11.055 --> 00:11.462
I know.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.720
Tom Brady. Now, Serena seems to be wavering a little.

00:14.900 --> 00:15.301
You're done?

00:15.397 --> 00:17.517
No, no. I am definitely done. I know that, yeah.

00:17.985 --> 00:22.680
41 years old, Federer will play his final professional games in the Laver Cup,...

00:22.821 --> 00:25.113
…a team tennis event he helped create.

00:25.599 --> 00:30.408
The capstone on a career that includes victories in every grand slam tournament...

00:30.803 --> 00:35.387
…and an astounding 237 consecutive weeks at number one.

00:35.618 --> 00:40.093
Is it one of those things where they say, sometimes, there's the stages of grief?

00:40.259 --> 00:42.081
Did you feel all those feelings?

00:42.154 --> 00:43.104
Yes, all of it.

00:43.233 --> 00:45.147
And also the ones where I don't want to deal with it.

00:45.233 --> 00:46.442
Like, I just don't want to think about it.

00:46.522 --> 00:47.514
Don't talk to me about it.

00:47.879 --> 00:53.055
I went through a lot of sadness and emotional moments where,..

00:55.158 --> 00:57.862
…just, you know, how you start thinking about everything you're gonna miss.

00:58.263 --> 01:01.611
And then, you just think, "Oh my god, my life's gonna be miserable after."

01:01.837 --> 01:04.687
And then you realize, no, no, no actually we're gonna have more time,...

01:04.759 --> 01:06.788
...so we're gonna do all these amazing things now.

01:06.871 --> 01:08.605
So, it's gonna be great, you know.

01:08.924 --> 01:11.997
The "we", his wife Mirka and their four children.

01:12.375 --> 01:16.605
For us, a last chance to savor a game of grace and power.
