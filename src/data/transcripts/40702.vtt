00:00.552 --> 00:02.699
Brazil's presidential election will be settled...

00:02.766 --> 00:05.283
...in a second round of voting on October the 30th.

00:05.684 --> 00:06.815
That's after no candidate...

00:06.975 --> 00:09.528
...took an absolute majority of votes on Sunday.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.745
With nearly all of the ballots counted,...

00:11.921 --> 00:14.523
...former president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva,...

00:14.652 --> 00:17.518
...who is simply known as Lula, has 48%,...

00:17.649 --> 00:19.380
...while incumbent Jair Bolsonaro...

00:19.637 --> 00:22.898
...received an unexpectedly strong 43%.

00:23.295 --> 00:26.563
Moderate Simone Tebet is trading with 4%.

00:27.865 --> 00:30.851
Lula spoke to supporters in the commercial capital Sao Paolo,...

00:30.939 --> 00:33.172
...putting an optimistic spin on the result.

00:34.966 --> 00:38.243
I always believed that we would win these elections,...

00:38.428 --> 00:42.088
...and what I can tell you is that we are going to win these elections.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.932
This is just extra time for us.

00:47.975 --> 00:50.998
The race has proven tighter than most surveys suggested,...

00:51.086 --> 00:54.491
...revitalizing incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro's campaign...

00:54.771 --> 00:57.819
...after he insisted that polls could not be trusted.

00:58.026 --> 01:02.098
His surprising showing dashed Lula's hopes of a quick win.

01:04.806 --> 01:08.943
I think we will form a good alliance to win the elections.
