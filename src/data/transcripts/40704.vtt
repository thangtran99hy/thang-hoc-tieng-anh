Coffee drinkers are toasting a new study...

00:02.312 --> 00:04.968
...linking a few cups a day to a longer life.

00:05.201 --> 00:07.528
As medical reporter Emily Rice explains,...

00:07.812 --> 00:09.735
...adding a little sugar doesn't hurt either.

00:10.734 --> 00:14.775
Tiamo restaurant manager Julio won't reveal his age,...

00:14.879 --> 00:20.478
...but will confirm he's been serving coffees in Melbourne cafes for 55 years.

00:20.798 --> 00:25.138
He credits his boundless energy to a couple of cups or more per day.

00:25.275 --> 00:29.219
A new study has found the popular brew may help you live longer.

00:29.466 --> 00:34.328
After examining the consumption habits of 170,000 people in the UK,...

00:34.652 --> 00:36.929
...researchers found regular coffee drinking...

00:36.993 --> 00:40.993
...was associated with a 30% mortality reduction...

00:41.389 --> 00:45.342
...and adding a teaspoon of sugar did not appear to reduce the benefits.

00:45.490 --> 00:48.634
Cardiologist Professor Peter Kisler from the Baker Institute...

00:48.703 --> 00:51.062
...conducted a similar study earlier this year...

00:51.360 --> 00:54.875
...which found coffee drinkers had a lower risk of heart problems.

00:55.076 --> 00:57.617
When it comes to the optimum dose of coffee,...

00:57.713 --> 00:59.749
...it differs from person to person,...

01:00.029 --> 01:03.807
...but like most things in life, moderation is key.
