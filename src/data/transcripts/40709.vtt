It's a familiar sight: North Korea testing its missiles.

00:05.291 --> 00:07.560
But Monday's launch was different.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.509
For the first time since 2017,....

00:10.578 --> 00:12.905
...a missile flew all the way over Japan.

00:13.329 --> 00:15.421
The latest launch, the fifth in a week,...

00:15.635 --> 00:16.935
...has been strongly condemned...

00:17.035 --> 00:19.861
...by South Korean and Japanese officials.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.325
North Korea's actions,...

00:24.412 --> 00:26.831
...including the repeated ballistic missile launches,...

00:27.029 --> 00:29.552
...are a threat to the peace and security of our country,...

00:29.804 --> 00:31.882
...region and international community,...

00:32.175 --> 00:34.293
...and it's a serious challenge for our country...

00:34.601 --> 00:36.639
...and the entire international community.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.492
People in Japan awoke to messages warning them...

00:40.589 --> 00:44.896
...to take shelter as rocket fragments landed in the Pacific Ocean.

00:45.627 --> 00:48.358
It's a serious escalation of military action...

00:48.560 --> 00:50.556
...as North Korea tests its rockets...

00:50.678 --> 00:53.592
...as well as the patience of its neighbors.

00:53.917 --> 00:58.311
Whatever Kim Jong Un's intentions, the outcome's already clear...

00:58.589 --> 01:01.823
...as the international community unites to condemn the action...

01:02.029 --> 01:05.940
...and Japan says it's consulting its allies on next steps.
