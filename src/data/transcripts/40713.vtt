I'm here in New York City to tell you some big news.

00:07.443 --> 00:10.334
This year, there are four amazing new iPhones.

00:10.475 --> 00:11.540
I'm going to tell you about them...

00:11.775 --> 00:13.547
...and help you understand the differences between them.

00:13.863 --> 00:17.425
One of the biggest changes this year to the display on iPhone 14 Pro...

00:17.575 --> 00:18.613
...is Dynamic Island.

00:19.774 --> 00:20.641
Let's take a closer look.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.879
Dynamic Island is a new way to interact with your iPhone.

00:24.349 --> 00:25.990
When you swipe out of a live activity,...

00:26.246 --> 00:29.130
...the app will magically fly right into Dynamic Island.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.753
Tap and hold to expand it for more controls.

00:32.214 --> 00:34.227
Dynamic Island can even show two activities...

00:34.360 --> 00:36.700
...like maps and music at the same time.

00:37.048 --> 00:39.035
It's the perfect blend of hardware and software...

00:39.258 --> 00:42.448
...that consolidates your alerts, notifications and background activity.

00:43.007 --> 00:45.336
So if Dynamic Island sounds like something you want,...

00:45.573 --> 00:48.935
...you should definitely grab the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max.

00:52.989 --> 00:55.621
All the new iPhones have two brand-new safety innovations:...

00:55.865 --> 00:58.613
...emergency SOS via satellite and crash detection.

00:59.063 --> 01:00.897
While we hope it's something you never have to use...

01:01.237 --> 01:02.799
...if you find yourself in a severe car crash,...

01:02.953 --> 01:05.980
...crash detection uses the all-new gyroscope and accelerometer...

01:06.048 --> 01:08.664
...to measure up to 256 g-force.

01:09.033 --> 01:09.721
When that happens,...

01:09.865 --> 01:12.763
...the feature can automatically call emergency services for you.

01:13.382 --> 01:14.420
That was close!

01:15.556 --> 01:17.038
Looks like no one got hurt.

01:17.568 --> 01:18.877
Except for my dogs.
