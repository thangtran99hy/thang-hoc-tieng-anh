Most people think of ancient Egypt when they picture a mummy,...

00:03.452 --> 00:06.742
...but actually they weren't the only people to make them.

00:07.086 --> 00:11.771
The spirit cave mummies found near Fallon, Nevada, in 1940...

00:11.875 --> 00:15.875
...were mummified more than 9,400 years ago.

00:16.398 --> 00:20.687
Before that, the oldest known mummy on earth still wasn't Egyptian.

00:20.896 --> 00:25.749
It was a child found in Chile and was from around 7,000 years ago.

00:25.977 --> 00:28.397
But it was only about 5,000 years ago...

00:28.465 --> 00:31.852
...that Egyptians started intentionally mummifying the dead.

00:31.952 --> 00:35.849
Part of the reason that Egyptian mummies are so much more well-known...

00:36.053 --> 00:39.341
...is because archeologists have dug up a ton of them.

00:39.811 --> 00:42.491
That's helped experts learn a lot of info about them,...

00:42.813 --> 00:47.129
...including the five basic steps for making a mummy the Egyptian way.

00:47.431 --> 00:51.701
They started by washing the body with wine and water from the Nile River.

00:51.897 --> 00:53.802
Then they removed the organs.

00:54.745 --> 00:58.818
Next, they cleaned the lungs, liver, stomachs and intestines...

00:58.941 --> 01:02.433
...and put them in special pots called canopic jars...

01:02.595 --> 01:04.784
...that are each shaped like an Egyptian god.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.990
The heart was considered the center of intelligence,...

01:08.177 --> 01:09.985
...so it was put back in the body.

01:10.183 --> 01:12.601
After that, they would bury the body completely...

01:12.681 --> 01:16.253
...in a special salt called natron for 40 days...

01:16.397 --> 01:18.197
...to get rid of all the moisture.

01:18.481 --> 01:21.285
Once the body was dry, they would take it out of the salt...

01:21.441 --> 01:25.043
....and fill it with rags, spices and plants to keep its shape.

01:25.341 --> 01:29.421
Finally, they would wrap it up in those famous linen fabric strips.
