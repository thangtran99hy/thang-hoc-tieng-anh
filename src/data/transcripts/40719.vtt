Artemis is NASA's plan to go back to the moon,...

00:04.491 --> 00:08.501
...and Snoopy is to be the zero gravity indicator.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.878
A zero G or zero gravity indicator demonstrates the moment...

00:12.963 --> 00:15.905
...that the crew and the spacecraft reach weightlessness.

00:16.209 --> 00:19.799
Snoopy is about to take his first trip around the moon.

00:20.049 --> 00:24.701
The relationship with NASA and Snoopy goes back about 50 years...

00:24.903 --> 00:26.160
...since the Apollo days.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.697
He was the face of the safety campaign,...

00:28.823 --> 00:33.424
...the icon for NASA's culture of safety and mission success.

00:33.672 --> 00:36.574
So NASA and Peanuts have a Space Act Agreement...

00:36.633 --> 00:40.751
...and we collaborate together on STEM content...

00:40.949 --> 00:44.373
...and we really were excited when it was decided...

00:44.450 --> 00:48.203
...that Snoopy would be the zero gravity indicator on Artemis 1.

00:48.326 --> 00:52.236
We wanted to go all-out so we created a custom Snoopy...

00:52.404 --> 00:55.332
...and the spacesuit is actually made out of material...

00:55.453 --> 00:57.008
...worn by the NASA astronauts.

00:57.189 --> 01:00.785
Everything was done with extreme detail.

01:00.939 --> 01:06.619
They cut patterns for his suit, even how his collar worked...

01:06.729 --> 01:09.489
...and how the NASA meatball logo looked.

01:11.685 --> 01:13.201
We're very excited.

01:13.269 --> 01:14.782
I'm personally very excited.

01:14.915 --> 01:19.101
I can't contain the excitement I am feeling about this day.

01:19.445 --> 01:23.187
Snoopy is going farther in space than he's ever been before.

01:23.307 --> 01:25.855
This is a day that we've all been waiting for.

01:26.030 --> 01:27.163
It's fantastic.
