And back here to Germany, the country's famous Oktoberfest...

00:03.253 --> 00:07.301
…has returned to Munich for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

00:07.763 --> 00:10.437
After a two-year hiatus, the festival opened...

00:10.506 --> 00:14.256
...as the mayor tapped the first keg and the beer started flowing.

00:14.403 --> 00:18.899
The world's biggest folk festival typically attracts millions of people to the city.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.903
Authorities say hospitals there...

00:20.988 --> 00:25.333
…will be able to cope with a potential rise in coronavirus cases.

00:25.686 --> 00:28.368
Oktoberfest runs until October third.

00:32.131 --> 00:36.243
Let's bring in DW correspondent, Benjamin Alvarez Gruber, in Munich...

00:36.301 --> 00:41.505
…standing by at the world's largest beer festival, the Oktoberfest.

00:41.849 --> 00:46.677
Benjamin, in addition to bottomless mugs of beer, I imagine,...

00:46.739 --> 00:48.807
...what's in store for visitors this year?

00:52.461 --> 00:54.457
It's right and the beer, it is already flowing.

00:54.531 --> 00:57.550
There are seventeen big tents and as you can see here behind me.

00:57.632 --> 01:00.892
There are queues of people who started coming to this place...

01:00.968 --> 01:03.750
…even before the doors opened at around nine,...

01:03.810 --> 01:05.863
...so there were people running to get to the tables.

01:05.939 --> 01:08.720
But, of course, for those who are here and don't want to drink beer,...

01:08.789 --> 01:10.019
…want to stay outdoors,...

01:10.336 --> 01:11.716
…there are also many other activities.

01:11.794 --> 01:14.976
There are games, there is a ferris wheel, so there's something for everyone.

01:15.074 --> 01:17.217
If a family, for example, is coming,...

01:17.460 --> 01:20.921
…they can also spend time outside and eat also delicious food.
