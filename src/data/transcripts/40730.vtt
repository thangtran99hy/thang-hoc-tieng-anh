Farming has been a central part of America since its founding.

00:04.535 --> 00:08.192
In the 19th century, homesteaders settled the American West.

00:08.701 --> 00:14.493
Today, America boasts 900 million acres of farmland, according to the USDA.

00:14.919 --> 00:20.281
That's 40% of our land, and our farms provide food across the world.

00:20.440 --> 00:27.007

00:27.077 --> 00:29.289
…like soybeans, corn, beef, and pork.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.651
According to the Department of Agriculture,...

00:31.721 --> 00:36.185
…American citizens own 97% of privately held farmland...

00:36.255 --> 00:38.097
…and forest in the United States.

00:38.543 --> 00:42.261
Some say U.S. farms are a global asset that should be shared.

00:42.942 --> 00:46.049
Bloomberg columnist, Adam Minter, wrote this in August,...

00:46.210 --> 00:51.977
"Food security is enhanced by outsiders who seek economic opportunity in farm country.

00:52.505 --> 00:53.578
They should be welcomed."

00:54.234 --> 00:59.732
Recently though, the 3% of farmland owned by foreigners has attracted controversy,...

00:59.803 --> 01:02.030
…specifically a focus on China.

01:02.484 --> 01:07.597

01:11.739 --> 01:14.185
…posed a severe threat to the autumn harvest.

…including the purchase of Virginia based pork producer, Smithfield Foods...

01:21.729 --> 01:24.745
...and partnership with Growmark, a grain logistics firm.

01:25.149 --> 01:31.640
Chinese companies own about a fifth of 1% of American agricultural land per USDA data,...

01:32.097 --> 01:36.332
…but some lawmakers say Chinese firms shouldn't own American farmland at all.

01:36.775 --> 01:40.053
America cannot allow China to control our food supply.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.659
And the president and the Congress...

01:42.879 --> 01:47.947
…should end all farm subsidies for land owned by foreign nationals.
