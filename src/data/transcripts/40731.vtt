00:00.247 --> 00:00.698
Hey there, Chance.

00:00.763 --> 00:03.301
Well, the President's declaration that the pandemic is over...

00:03.373 --> 00:05.553
...just not really squaring with reality.

00:05.625 --> 00:09.627
The WHO saying it is not over, though we are nearing the end.

00:09.701 --> 00:13.437
And then, now is certainly not the time to be letting up on the gas pedal.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.075
Even the President's own chief medical advisor, as you heard saying,...

00:18.149 --> 00:19.761
...this is a complicated picture...

00:19.837 --> 00:23.310
...and that we're not where we need to be to live with this virus.

00:23.378 --> 00:28.101
The CDC still reporting 360 daily deaths from the coronavirus.

00:28.175 --> 00:31.436
That is far from the peaks we saw...

00:31.498 --> 00:37.143
...in the thousands in the winters of 2020-2021 and 2021-2022.

00:37.224 --> 00:41.706
But it is not near that low that we saw mid-2021,...

00:41.773 --> 00:46.125
...and certainly 360 people a day is 360 too many,...

00:46.197 --> 00:48.455
...depending on how you look at this.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.459
If we are going to live with this virus,...

00:50.539 --> 00:54.039
...public health officials say we need to continue to be vigilant for now,...

00:54.110 --> 00:55.959
...especially as we near the colder months...

00:56.239 --> 00:59.481
...when there could be more of a take-off in case counts.

00:59.555 --> 01:02.517
And get those booster vaccine shots...

01:02.589 --> 01:05.279
...that are now available to everyone over the age of 12,...

01:05.363 --> 01:07.985
...even the second gentleman and Dr. Ashish Jha,...

01:08.067 --> 01:10.305
...who is directing the COVID response,...

01:10.564 --> 01:15.428
...getting very public booster shots just last week in part to promote that.

01:15.781 --> 01:17.675
And then, of course, you had the President this weekend...

01:17.738 --> 01:19.767
...saying that the pandemic was over.

01:19.832 --> 01:22.878
Just a very different sort of tact to take...

01:22.944 --> 01:26.555
...from the rest of the global community and even his own administration.

01:26.631 --> 01:29.769
Just listen to what the director general of the World Health Organization...

01:29.839 --> 01:31.215
...had to say about where we are right now...

01:31.281 --> 01:33.245
...in this fight and what we need to do going forward.

01:33.815 --> 01:38.173
We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic.

01:40.315 --> 01:46.119
We're not there yet, but the end is in sight.

01:48.005 --> 01:52.789
A marathon runner does not stop when the finish line comes into view.

01:53.970 --> 01:57.793
She runs harder with all the energy she has left.
