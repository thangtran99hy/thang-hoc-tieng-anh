India generates more garbage...

00:03.795 --> 00:06.725
...than every country in the world besides China.

00:07.945 --> 00:10.984
The government has taken steps to address all this waste,...

00:11.785 --> 00:14.307
...including a ban on single-use plastics.

00:15.439 --> 00:18.656
But across the country, people are tackling the issue on their own.

00:20.588 --> 00:26.000

00:57.661 --> 01:00.112
...that will power street lights, buildings,...

01:00.565 --> 01:03.381
...and a kitchen that preps meals for 800 people.

01:04.337 --> 01:06.303
This is called biogas.

01:06.675 --> 01:09.014
It's plentiful, it's low-tech,...

01:09.625 --> 01:13.095
...and experts say it burns cleaner than any fossil fuel.
