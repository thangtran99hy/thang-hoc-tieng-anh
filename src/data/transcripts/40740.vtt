A cost of living crisis is unfolding in America's major cities.

00:04.539 --> 00:08.517
We can't afford to live in this city if you're a working class New Yorker.

00:08.989 --> 00:11.321
The problems are acute in downtown Manhattan.

00:11.647 --> 00:16.082
One-bedroom units are renting for nearly $4,000 a month on average.

00:16.498 --> 00:18.382
There's a reason people are willing to pay.

00:18.549 --> 00:20.130
It drives you and it motivates you...

00:20.315 --> 00:21.192
...and it keeps you hungry.

00:21.307 --> 00:22.335
It keeps you always thinking...

00:22.455 --> 00:25.268
...because, no matter what, you know there's somebody out there hustling more.

00:25.349 --> 00:26.847
There's somebody thinking something new.

00:27.097 --> 00:28.313
You can never become complacent.

00:28.623 --> 00:30.818
That's what's so beautiful about this city.

00:31.505 --> 00:34.797
People have returned to cities to see their friends and have a good time.

00:35.505 --> 00:39.224
That's pushing rents to new highs in places like Los Angeles, Chicago...

00:39.309 --> 00:41.279
...and cities across the Sun Belt.

00:42.517 --> 00:45.137
While renters have returned, many commuters haven't...

00:45.483 --> 00:47.271
...despite the return-to-office push...

00:47.559 --> 00:50.526
...from major companies like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.

00:51.563 --> 00:55.624
More days at home could help workers escape high city prices and long commutes,...

00:56.011 --> 00:58.303
...but there could be a cost to that decision.

00:58.570 --> 01:00.605
As prices keep rising across the country,...

01:00.797 --> 01:04.327
...we ask, are American major cities like New York still worth it?
