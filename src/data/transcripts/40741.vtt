Zero-emission aircraft is really about Airbus having the ambition...

00:07.201 --> 00:15.360
...to bring an aircraft which can fly with no impact on the climate to reality by 2035.

00:15.733 --> 00:21.035
We see it as a moral obligation that we need to bring climate-neutral flying to society.

00:22.957 --> 00:28.321
So what we're talking about here is really powering aviation with renewable energy.

00:32.035 --> 00:36.280
We're going to be developing the technology, testing that technology on ground.

00:36.374 --> 00:39.113
And what we're also going to start seeing are flight demonstrators,...

00:39.197 --> 00:40.974
...which means we're going to take that technology,...

00:41.227 --> 00:44.083
...put it into an aircraft and fly it, test it to its limits...

00:44.159 --> 00:45.827
...and really understand the performance.

00:47.283 --> 00:50.037
This challenge is not only about an airplane,...

00:50.377 --> 00:55.282
...it's about having the right fuse hydrogen at the right time,...

00:55.363 --> 00:58.071
...at the right place, in the right quantity, at the right price.

00:58.245 --> 01:00.575
And there were people who said, "No, that's not going to happen.

01:00.737 --> 01:01.247
What are you saying?"

01:01.921 --> 01:03.078
Of course, it will happen.

01:05.667 --> 01:09.172
I believe that this is the most exciting change...

01:09.255 --> 01:12.357
...that the aviation industry has ever seen.

01:12.571 --> 01:17.213
So let's leverage now the energy and the enthusiasm...

01:17.585 --> 01:22.820
...and derive concrete actions to meet those ambitious targets together.
