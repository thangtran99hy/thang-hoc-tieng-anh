Welcome to "I'm Your Target Demographic"...

00:10.585 --> 00:12.929
...and today we're discussing e-sports.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.123
This video is not intended for people...

00:15.187 --> 00:17.225
...that are familiar, know this topic inside-out,...

00:17.605 --> 00:20.041
...but rather for folks that don't know what this means...

00:20.217 --> 00:22.313
...or don't understand its significance.

00:22.537 --> 00:23.937
So if you're in the first category,...

00:24.202 --> 00:26.927
...share this video with someone in the second category.

00:27.389 --> 00:29.733
What does the term "e-sport" mean?

00:30.165 --> 00:32.847
It's literally short for electronic sports,...

00:32.941 --> 00:35.307
...meaning video games that can be played competitively...

00:35.573 --> 00:37.677
...either as an individual or as a team.

00:38.413 --> 00:42.093
This idea of competing has existed since video games themselves have existed.

00:42.196 --> 00:44.857
We had people playing Space Invaders to beat the high score.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.563
Arcades were places where heroes could be made,...

00:47.661 --> 00:50.526
...people breaking records and becoming local celebrities.

00:51.129 --> 00:52.873
When PC gaming became popular,...

00:52.961 --> 00:55.273
...this is where people began to play against strangers,...

00:55.444 --> 00:57.252
...people who could be in other countries.

00:57.745 --> 01:00.884
This launched the era of international icons,...

01:01.104 --> 01:04.164
...teams and players that could claim to be the best in the world.

01:04.446 --> 01:05.775
We jump forward to now.

01:06.008 --> 01:07.575
This is not a history lesson.

01:07.909 --> 01:10.170
There are many games that are considered e-sports...

01:10.317 --> 01:13.643
...that have tournaments and prizes and plenty of chances for people to compete.

01:14.133 --> 01:17.401
If you're a developer and you can find a way to make your game competitive,...

01:17.773 --> 01:20.677
...this can extend the lifetime of the game considerably.

01:21.339 --> 01:24.143
However, many games tout themselves as an e-sport,...

01:24.473 --> 01:25.793
...but if they don't gain traction,...

01:25.868 --> 01:27.941
...their competitive scene is not strong...

01:28.119 --> 01:30.795
...and this could make or break the reputation of the game.
