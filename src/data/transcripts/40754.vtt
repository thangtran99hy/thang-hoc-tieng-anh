00:00.372 --> 00:03.546
The thing is, most cars are made with more than one seat.

00:04.188 --> 00:05.589
The problem is that most car owners...

00:05.693 --> 00:08.043
...forget to share these seats on their daily commute.

00:08.528 --> 00:12.169
But if they did, it would reduce traffic by allowing other drivers...

00:12.262 --> 00:13.575
...to leave their cars at home.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.849
And there would still be seat spare for other commuters too,...

00:17.345 --> 00:19.871
...which means that passengers would be able to commute to work...

00:19.971 --> 00:22.937
...in the comfort of a taxi just for their share of the fuel.

00:23.461 --> 00:25.398
And drivers would have their fuel bill covered...

00:25.549 --> 00:27.483
...just for driving to work like they always do.

00:28.115 --> 00:28.967
So how does it work?

00:29.418 --> 00:33.381
Download the Wonder Carpool app via Google Play Store or the App Store.

00:34.634 --> 00:38.659
Sign up, set up your starting point, destination and the time you want to commute...

00:38.982 --> 00:40.553
...and then let the magic happen.

00:41.158 --> 00:43.459
Drivers will be shown passengers heading in their direction...

00:43.573 --> 00:44.682
...and can offer them a ride.

00:45.221 --> 00:47.941
Passengers can request rides from drivers heading on their route.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.274
It's a win-win for drivers and passengers.

00:51.764 --> 00:53.669
One that results in sharing costs,...

00:54.384 --> 00:57.987
...stories and the responsibility of reducing traffic.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.288
And unlike taxi services with carpooling side products,...

01:01.501 --> 01:05.299
...the Wonder Carpool community is dedicated to taking cars off the road.

01:06.007 --> 01:09.029
So if you're serious about building a better future for your children,...

01:09.407 --> 01:10.725
...there is only one option.
