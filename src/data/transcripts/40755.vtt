The story behind SHARE NOW...

00:02.489 --> 00:06.021
...is the story behind making cities more livable.

00:08.099 --> 00:11.022
Describing car-sharing is answering the question,...

00:11.270 --> 00:15.527
..."Do we really need to own our car or is it better to share?"

00:16.635 --> 00:18.718
Our answer is yes.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.832
We should own less and share much more.

00:33.196 --> 00:37.559
In 2008 with Car2Go, when we started free-floating car-sharing,...

00:37.884 --> 00:40.465
...it was clear that most of the cities...

00:40.611 --> 00:44.125
...are struggling with air pollution, traffic jams,...

00:44.464 --> 00:47.832
...and we wanted to find a way to make mobility...

00:48.280 --> 00:50.403
...more efficient and more sustainable.

00:53.027 --> 00:58.890
We share 11,000 cars with three million customers in eight countries, 16 cities,...

00:59.219 --> 01:03.467
...and we are part of the mobility ecosystem of those cities.

01:06.026 --> 01:08.688
We're believing and changing the way of mobility.

01:08.923 --> 01:12.286
We saw and assumed the usage of the mobile devices...

01:12.507 --> 01:13.742
...will grow significantly.

01:14.222 --> 01:15.703
That's why we wanted to offer...

01:15.770 --> 01:17.903
...the most easiest solution to our customers...

01:17.985 --> 01:19.291
...by only offering the app.

01:19.421 --> 01:21.597
When you want to start, simply open your app.

01:21.785 --> 01:24.181
You'll see if there's a car pretty close to you,...

01:24.415 --> 01:27.379
...pick the car, reserve it, walk to the car,...

01:27.731 --> 01:30.252
...and then you can easily open the car up with the app...

01:30.437 --> 01:32.407
...by confirming the rental button.

01:32.578 --> 01:34.553
This will happen within a few seconds.
