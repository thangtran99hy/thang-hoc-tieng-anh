Quinceanera is a coming-of-age.

00:01.921 --> 00:04.573
It's basically a girl turning into a young woman...

00:04.909 --> 00:09.018
...and her parents are showing society that she is all grown-up.

00:09.131 --> 00:11.129
Most little girls dream about their wedding.

00:11.286 --> 00:15.662
Hispanics, most little girls dream about the day that they're gonna turn 15...

00:15.818 --> 00:17.007
...and become a quinceanera...

00:17.075 --> 00:19.671
...and their mom is dreaming about the day...

00:19.747 --> 00:21.230
...that their daughter turns 15.

00:21.324 --> 00:22.441
All the family comes.

00:22.526 --> 00:26.753
It's a very important way to bring people together.

00:26.898 --> 00:28.218
You look very good at it.

00:30.127 --> 00:32.225
It doesn't matter where you come from in the part of the world.

00:32.367 --> 00:35.730
We're all coming together to celebrate a quinceanera.

00:35.843 --> 00:36.931
So it doesn't matter where you come from...

00:37.122 --> 00:38.627
...because everybody loves a good party.

00:38.707 --> 00:41.414
People from other cultures, they're intrigued by it.

00:41.511 --> 00:45.201
It's something that maybe they kind of heard about it a little bit.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.418
They see that it's a party, it's a celebration.

00:47.522 --> 00:50.464
So I think it's something that they will embrace and love...

00:50.935 --> 00:53.339
...and maybe even want to do it for their daughters.
