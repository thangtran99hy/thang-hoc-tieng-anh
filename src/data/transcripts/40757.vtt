00:22.829 --> 00:25.499
So we're here on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu...

00:25.575 --> 00:27.409
...with Lindblad Expeditions, National Geographic,...

00:27.485 --> 00:29.955
...and work the land divers.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.643
Land diving developed in Vanuatu dating back many centuries.

00:36.687 --> 00:39.398
While the exact reason for the diving isn't known,...

00:39.621 --> 00:43.387
...the timing of the diving in April and May is tied to the yam harvest.

00:43.932 --> 00:46.635
A great dive ensures a bountiful harvest.

00:48.667 --> 00:51.693
Diving is thought to help the health and strength of the divers...

00:52.214 --> 00:54.569
...and, of course, to show off their masculinity.

01:01.193 --> 01:02.475
The camera's going to be up there,...

01:02.562 --> 01:03.837
...and we hopefully going to capture it...

01:04.161 --> 01:06.313
Probably not done before with a GoPro.

01:06.535 --> 01:07.323
Incredible event!

01:07.403 --> 01:09.288
They're gonna tie vines to their ankles and jump off,...

01:09.427 --> 01:11.006
...and we're gonna hopefully capture it all.
