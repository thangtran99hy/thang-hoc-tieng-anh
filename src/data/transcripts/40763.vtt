00:00.449 --> 00:04.575
The Asakusa Sensoji Temple in Tokyo finally stands before them...

00:05.197 --> 00:07.193
...after two and a half years of waiting.

00:07.580 --> 00:10.907
We've talked about coming since before COVID.

00:11.265 --> 00:12.903
It was a dream of ours.

00:13.183 --> 00:16.342
Even before getting jobs and stuff, it was just a dream.

00:16.643 --> 00:18.354
And now we're here.

00:19.033 --> 00:22.342
These university exchange students are also excited to be here.

00:22.975 --> 00:24.720
I mean, when I was signing up for this program,...

00:24.789 --> 00:27.427
...I was, like, constantly told that it might not happen.

00:27.703 --> 00:27.970
Right?

00:28.046 --> 00:31.252
So now that I'm finally here, I feel amazing.

00:31.785 --> 00:34.868
However, it isn't the foreign tourist who had it the worst.

00:35.091 --> 00:36.506
Harimacho is a guide.

00:36.767 --> 00:39.895
The pandemic has had a strong impact on his business.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.543
There was a time when he was peaking and there would be no one.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.599
Decrease was crazy.

00:46.979 --> 00:48.868
It was one tenth of what it used to be.

00:49.313 --> 00:50.403
Nobody was coming.

00:53.299 --> 00:55.328
In addition to the reopening of the country,...

00:55.387 --> 00:57.023
...there's also the fall of the Japanese yen,...

00:57.100 --> 00:58.606
...which is really good news for tourists.

00:58.922 --> 01:00.335
Look here at the menu on the street.

01:01.009 --> 01:05.623
This full meal costs only 1,000 yen, which is 7 euros or 7 dollars,...

01:05.816 --> 01:07.869
...and chefs are very well aware of this.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.415
I'll charge my customer the same.

01:16.091 --> 01:20.119
As for my income, when foreigners are able to come to the country smoothly,...

01:20.483 --> 01:21.953
...I'm expecting it to double.

01:24.323 --> 01:29.351
Just before the pandemic, 31 million tourists visited Japan in 2019,...

01:29.561 --> 01:31.230
...a historic record for the country.

01:31.481 --> 01:33.620
After two and a half years of travel restrictions,...

01:33.811 --> 01:36.437
...the nation hopes to revive this trend as soon as possible.
