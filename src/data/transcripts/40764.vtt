00:00.411 --> 00:02.992
Picture yourself at the top of Mount Fuji.

00:03.346 --> 00:06.215
If you look down, you'll see a futuristic city...

00:06.353 --> 00:09.303
...nestled between the sprawling green tea fields.

00:09.701 --> 00:12.549
That's Toyota's ten-billion-dollar Woven City.

00:12.878 --> 00:16.031
It has an innovative basket-like design that's intertwined...

00:16.109 --> 00:18.689
...with three types of roads, smart houses,...

00:18.802 --> 00:22.245
...research facilities, and an underground transport system.

00:22.609 --> 00:26.177
Three hundred sixty of Toyota's best inventors live in Woven City,...

00:26.355 --> 00:28.705
...and they are constantly working on new technologies...

00:28.782 --> 00:30.185
...to assist the city's residents.

00:30.565 --> 00:33.375
Woven City is years away from becoming a reality,...

00:33.673 --> 00:35.619
...but today we're giving you a sneak peek.

00:36.073 --> 00:37.798
Let's head down for a closer look.

00:38.346 --> 00:43.289
It looks like that 10,000 dollar Toyota e-Palette autonomous vehicle is empty.

00:43.496 --> 00:46.349
So let's hop inside and take a drive-through Woven City.

00:46.692 --> 00:49.533
The first thing you'll notice is just how big the city is.

00:49.789 --> 00:54.381
It was built on 175 acres and is home to 360 inventors...

00:54.550 --> 00:58.527
...as well as seniors with mobility issues and families with young children.

00:58.785 --> 01:02.775
Eventually, 2,000 Toyota employees will call Woven City home...

01:03.115 --> 01:05.688
...and there will be people from all demographics living here,...

01:05.765 --> 01:08.674
...including retirees, scientists and retailers.

01:09.044 --> 01:12.096
You'll notice that Woven City uses a unique grid system...

01:12.222 --> 01:14.790
...made up of three types of interconnected roads.

01:14.939 --> 01:18.018
We're on a road built specifically for autonomous vehicles,...

01:18.382 --> 01:21.297
...but over there, you'll notice a road made for pedestrians...

01:21.387 --> 01:23.513
...as well as people on bikes or scooters.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.163
That road over there doubles as a linear park...

01:26.391 --> 01:27.846
...and is only for pedestrians.

01:28.183 --> 01:31.280
All three types of roads flow together seamlessly.

01:31.636 --> 01:34.407
Traffic congestion is never a problem in Woven City,...

01:34.637 --> 01:37.921
...and the roads elegantly weave through the smart houses and buildings.

01:38.209 --> 01:41.139
You'll also notice that there's no pollution in Woven City.

01:41.385 --> 01:43.048
The air is crisp and fresh...

01:43.129 --> 01:45.585
...because there are miniature parks around every corner.

01:45.833 --> 01:49.642
The roads are lined with shrubs, fruit trees and cherry blossom trees.

01:49.941 --> 01:51.487
In true Japanese fashion,...

01:51.629 --> 01:55.155
...Woven City's technology blends seamlessly with nature.
