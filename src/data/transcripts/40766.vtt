00:00.191 --> 00:02.115
It's known as the Doomsday Glacier,...

00:02.257 --> 00:04.588
...and scientists are growing more concerned about it.

00:04.981 --> 00:08.330
The Thwaites glacier in Antarctica is one of the largest on earth...

00:08.404 --> 00:10.474
...and is larger than the state of Florida.

00:10.564 --> 00:15.251
According to a new study, scientists say sometime in the last 200 years,...

00:15.339 --> 00:21.845
...the base of the glacier retreated twice as much than observed in the last 10 years.

00:22.151 --> 00:25.845
That means the glacier can shrink much faster than previously thought.

00:26.003 --> 00:30.296
If it collapses, scientists say the global sea level could increase several feet...

00:30.591 --> 00:33.483
...and put coastlines at risk of destruction.

00:33.577 --> 00:37.526
Joining us now to talk more about this concerning finding, Terry Tamminen.

00:37.609 --> 00:41.181
He's the president and CEO of Altasea at the Port of Los Angeles.

00:41.471 --> 00:42.947
Thank you so much for your time, sir.

00:43.249 --> 00:46.643
How concerned should we be about this glacier melting?

00:48.091 --> 00:49.591
We should be very concerned.

00:49.863 --> 00:52.680
Scientists have been telling us about this for quite some time,...

00:53.075 --> 00:59.097
...and in parallel with that, the Greenland ice mass is suffering a similar decline.

00:59.496 --> 01:02.195
And part of what we're starting to learn now with new science,...

01:02.297 --> 01:05.129
...both in terms of the Thwaites glacier and Greenland,...

01:05.559 --> 01:11.898
...is how fast the meltwater underneath these giant ice floes is melting.

01:12.029 --> 01:16.175
And that's something thatâ€™s been much harder to study because you can't get cameras...

01:16.249 --> 01:18.906
...down there and sensors, although now they're starting to do that.

01:19.386 --> 01:20.882
And what we're finding is, you know,...

01:20.979 --> 01:24.991
...imagine that you had some ice on the top of your table...

01:25.348 --> 01:28.417
...and then suddenly you had some water underneath it.

01:28.493 --> 01:31.145
Well, it would slide much faster off the table.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.317
And the same thing is happening here.

01:33.713 --> 01:36.591
And so I think we need to be very concerned...

01:36.684 --> 01:39.544
...because the consequences of this happening rapidly,...

01:39.626 --> 01:43.435
...especially if it happens both in the Arctic and the Antarctic at the same time,...

01:43.968 --> 01:49.099
...that could just be catastrophic to our coastal cities and infrastructure.
