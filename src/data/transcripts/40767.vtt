00:00.105 --> 00:01.793
The Federal Reserve is expected to announce...

00:01.863 --> 00:06.651
…a third consecutive 75 basis point interest hike today.

00:06.758 --> 00:06.997
That's right.

00:07.078 --> 00:08.359
A lot of folks will be saying "ouch",...

00:08.445 --> 00:12.505
…because this action would mark the fifth rate increase this year.

00:12.795 --> 00:16.565
The aggressive move is part of the Fed's strategy to fight inflation,...

00:16.847 --> 00:19.505
…and this would come roughly one week after the Labor Department...

00:19.595 --> 00:21.891
…released the latest consumer price index report.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.995
That CPI report showed prices in this country...

00:25.075 --> 00:28.082
…remained near a four decade high last month.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.131
Joining us now is Mark Hamrick.

00:30.206 --> 00:33.072
He is a senior economic analyst for bankrate.com

00:33.379 --> 00:34.551
Mark, thanks for being here.

00:34.663 --> 00:37.029
Please explain to our viewers...

00:37.345 --> 00:40.312
…who is going to be most affected by this interest rate hike.

00:41.443 --> 00:45.076
Americans. People who are participants in our economy.

00:45.649 --> 00:46.969
That's everyone, Mark.

00:47.433 --> 00:48.620
Exactly. That's what I mean.

00:48.737 --> 00:50.293
Everyone will be affected by this.

00:51.373 --> 00:55.581
This is a far-reaching action on the part of the Federal Reserve.

00:55.668 --> 00:59.972
And it reverberates all around the world, so it has a global impact as well.

01:00.187 --> 01:03.983
The people who have been feeling some of the pain year-to-date...

01:04.194 --> 01:06.321
…are those who have exposure to the stock market.

01:06.413 --> 01:07.764
We know we're in a bear market.

01:07.979 --> 01:10.181
We know that the housing market is slow today.

01:10.281 --> 01:13.585
We had the seventh straight month of decline in existing home sales.

01:13.861 --> 01:14.839
But, make no mistake.

01:14.910 --> 01:18.246
Inflation has taken all consumers hostage.

01:18.525 --> 01:19.706
Businesses as well.

01:19.786 --> 01:22.707
And so, the Fed is prescribing further medicine,...

01:22.931 --> 01:26.063
…and as you said, this is the strongest medicine that it has delivered...

01:26.138 --> 01:27.660
...in the sense of the third straight,...

01:27.751 --> 01:32.490
…presumably, interest rate hike of 75 basis points in the third of five.
