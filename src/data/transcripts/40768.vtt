In Iran this morning, the Army vows to quote,...

00:02.555 --> 00:07.414
..."confront the enemies and put down a series of deadly protests mostly led by women."

00:07.801 --> 00:11.535
The protesters are furious over the recent death of a 22-year old woman...

00:11.872 --> 00:13.399
...after she was taken into custody...

00:13.469 --> 00:17.127
...accused of violating Iran's rigid dress code for women there.

00:17.565 --> 00:19.456
Ramy Inocencio reports on the women...

00:19.559 --> 00:24.083
...who are challenging some of the basic underpinnings Iran's Islamic regime.

00:26.807 --> 00:29.624
Taking off their head coverings and waving them in the air.

00:31.856 --> 00:34.165
This is defiance in Iran.

00:35.589 --> 00:37.567
And women are leading the charge.

00:37.783 --> 00:42.310
Some are even burning their hijabs, their mandatory head coverings, in protest.

00:42.901 --> 00:45.924
Sparked by the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini,...

00:46.227 --> 00:48.421
...police allege she suffered a heart attack...

00:48.500 --> 00:51.567
...after being arrested for wearing an improper hijab.

00:52.030 --> 00:54.575
They released this security footage showing her collapse.

00:54.802 --> 00:59.637
CBS News cannot verify its authenticity, but critics believe she was beaten,...

00:59.839 --> 01:01.868
...saying her body was bruised and bleeding.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.986
It all started with a hijab.

01:04.349 --> 01:05.124
How is that possible?

01:05.307 --> 01:12.297
There is a morality police that polices the streets, brings women in, punishes them.

01:12.711 --> 01:15.655
Sanam Vakil is an expert in Iranian policy.

01:16.369 --> 01:21.003
The morality police are enforcers of Iran's strict Islamic dress code,...

01:21.265 --> 01:23.087
...well-documented confronting women,...

01:23.256 --> 01:26.829
...sometimes violently, for not covering their heads or bodies.

01:27.013 --> 01:30.459
For conservatives and hardliners within the system,...

01:30.555 --> 01:34.482
...the hijab can be a source of power or source of identity.

01:34.550 --> 01:37.991
For people that are against the hijab, it is the question of choice.

01:39.243 --> 01:42.917
Really their lack of choice, under Iran's version of Islamic law.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.205
But angry Iranians are trying to break that.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.125
Striking its symbols of government authority...

01:51.155 --> 01:53.845
...and stoning an image of Iran's supreme leader.

01:55.231 --> 01:59.591
Some women are cutting their hair in front of clapping crowds in solidarity.
