BTS are global pop superstars.

00:05.899 --> 00:09.123
They've contributed billions of dollars to their country's economy...

00:09.445 --> 00:13.175
...and are more than most to generate interest in South Korean culture.

00:13.427 --> 00:16.301
They've even got involved in issues outside the pop world.

00:18.531 --> 00:22.061
Perhaps the world's biggest band has spoken at the United Nations...

00:22.563 --> 00:24.837
...and that President Biden at the White House.

00:25.591 --> 00:29.640
But in South Korea, all able-bodied men have to undergo military service...

00:29.725 --> 00:31.435
...before the age of 30.

00:31.762 --> 00:34.643
They have to join up for between 18 and 21 months.

00:35.227 --> 00:36.790
There's been a national debate about...

00:36.886 --> 00:39.175
...whether BTS should be given an exemption...

00:39.665 --> 00:42.791
...because of the huge service they've already given to South Korea.

00:43.363 --> 00:45.964
The issue has even been discussed in the National Assembly.

00:46.293 --> 00:50.172
The seven band members have now ended the speculation about their futures.

00:50.449 --> 00:53.019
In a statement, they said they would serve in the military...

00:53.324 --> 00:56.297
...out of respect, they said, for their country's needs.

00:58.063 --> 01:00.205
That means resisting North Korea.

01:00.642 --> 01:02.980
Among the glamour and glitter of the music business,...

01:03.347 --> 01:06.479
...it's easy to forget that Seoul is under constant threat...

01:06.612 --> 01:08.899
...from its belligerent neighbor to the north.

01:09.777 --> 01:10.785
So for a few years,...

01:10.908 --> 01:14.664
...BTS will say goodbye to the red carpet and screaming fans.

01:15.043 --> 01:18.011
They'll exchange formal wear for army fatigues,...

01:19.361 --> 01:23.839
...but they'll be back in three years when their time in the military is done.

01:24.261 --> 01:26.266
