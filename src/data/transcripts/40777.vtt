00:00.024 --> 00:02.311
What humans will look like in a thousand years.

00:03.181 --> 00:04.481
Humans are still evolving.

00:04.747 --> 00:07.415
So where will evolution take us in a thousand years?

00:07.805 --> 00:09.581
Chances are we'll be taller.

00:09.967 --> 00:13.766
Humans have already seen a boom in height over the last 130 years.

00:14.325 --> 00:17.697
In 1880, the average American male was five foot seven.

00:18.173 --> 00:20.145
Today, he's five foot ten.

00:20.847 --> 00:22.365
We may also merge with machines...

00:22.512 --> 00:26.741
...that can enhance our hearing, eyesight, health and much more.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.395
Right now, there are hearing aids that let you record sounds,...

00:30.741 --> 00:34.119
...generate white noise and even come with a built-in phone.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.917
Another example is a team out of the University of Oregon,...

00:38.014 --> 00:41.397
...which is developing bionic eyes that help the blind to see,...

00:41.932 --> 00:45.609
...but it's not impossible to imagine that this technology could become a tool...

00:45.693 --> 00:48.296
...for seeing what we currently consider invisible...

00:48.586 --> 00:52.281
...like different energies of light, such as infrared and x-rays.

00:52.630 --> 00:54.029
There will eventually be a day...

00:54.099 --> 00:56.902
...where prosthetics are no longer just for the disabled.

00:57.297 --> 01:00.527
However, it's not just our outside appearance that will change.

01:00.761 --> 01:05.341
Our genes will also evolve on microscopic levels to aid our survival.

01:05.842 --> 01:08.926
Another way to jumpstart the human evolution on a different path...

01:09.043 --> 01:11.231
...is to move some of us to Mars.

01:11.597 --> 01:14.515
Mars receives 66 percent less sunlight than Earth,...

01:15.023 --> 01:17.931
...which can mean humans on Mars will evolve larger pupils...

01:18.091 --> 01:20.487
...that can absorb more light in order to see.

01:20.693 --> 01:24.856
And since Mars' gravitational pull is only 38 percent of Earth's,...

01:25.170 --> 01:28.800
...people born on Mars might actually be taller than anyone on Earth.

01:29.115 --> 01:31.699
The path to immortality will likely require humans...

01:31.780 --> 01:34.127
...to download their consciousness into a machine.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.755
Right now, scientists in Italy and China...

01:36.831 --> 01:38.935
...are performing head transplants on animals...

01:39.051 --> 01:42.998
...to determine if you can transfer consciousness from one body to another.

01:43.527 --> 01:47.027
They claim their next big step is to transplant human heads.

01:47.422 --> 01:49.436
Whatever happens in the next thousand years,...

01:49.563 --> 01:51.885
...whether we merge with machines or become them,...

01:52.113 --> 01:55.575
...one thing is certain: the human race is always changing.

01:55.817 --> 01:58.162
And the faster we change and branch out from Earth,...

01:58.295 --> 02:01.379
...the better chance we have of outrunning extinction.
