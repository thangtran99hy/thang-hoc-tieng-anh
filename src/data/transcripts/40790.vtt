Rides today are obviously more sophisticated than they were...

00:04.276 --> 00:06.418
...even five years ago, ten years ago.

00:06.824 --> 00:09.389
But if you look at the data, you will actually see...

00:09.801 --> 00:14.831
...from 20 years ago until now, you'll see a decrease in the incidence level.

00:15.117 --> 00:20.946
Our industry uses the same software, the same skill set...

00:21.023 --> 00:23.152
...that comes out of the aerospace industry...

00:23.711 --> 00:29.942
...that allows us to make rides extremely exciting but extremely safe at the same time.

00:30.851 --> 00:33.364
Parks have to deal with a variety of challenges...

00:33.567 --> 00:36.866
...like obese and disabled people wanting to ride roller coasters.

00:37.314 --> 00:41.707
A report showed that the teen who died at ICON Park exceeded the ride's weight limit.

00:42.057 --> 00:45.949
We train them to, how to have that tough conversation...

00:46.175 --> 00:50.041
...when somebody may not be eligible to ride a ride for whatever reason that might be.

00:50.233 --> 00:54.805
All of our team members go through what we call verbal judo and tactical communication.

00:56.197 --> 01:00.414
It's for them to learn how to defuse the situation...

01:00.491 --> 01:04.501
...and bring the level down from here back down to an opportunity...

01:04.590 --> 01:07.983
...where we can actually address the issue that is affecting the guests.
