For this house, I wanted to make each room very special and different from the next.

00:07.067 --> 00:09.614
When curating the collection of art for this house,...

00:09.937 --> 00:14.345
...I wanted to highlight emerging artists from underrepresented communities.

00:14.641 --> 00:17.697
I was able to get really creative with argyle design.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.767
I had such an amazing time designing this house with them.

00:21.072 --> 00:25.251
This is actually my reception room, kind of formal living room.

00:25.335 --> 00:29.571
I wanted it to feel very maximalist and creative.

00:29.645 --> 00:33.441
There's like this amazing piece by Hannah Epstein called White Pumps.

00:33.696 --> 00:35.293
I love my yellow couch.

00:35.379 --> 00:36.807
I think it brightens up the room.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.333
I love the rug from House of Hackney.

00:39.434 --> 00:44.818
We've got this statue in the corner that I think just gives it a really chic touch.

00:44.983 --> 00:49.573
The chandelier in this room is designed by Moooi and it's called Meshmatics,...

00:49.651 --> 00:51.616
...and I think what's really beautiful about this...

00:51.688 --> 00:53.937
...is it brings a soft touch to the rest of the room.

00:54.043 --> 00:59.728
Literally, the purpose of this room is just to give it that wow factor...

00:59.806 --> 01:01.400
...when people walk into the house.

01:01.511 --> 01:04.953
I literally spend no time in here, but my dogs love it.
