00:01.305 --> 00:05.549
We detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure.

00:05.719 --> 00:09.131
I didn't used to think that a foreign military would come after us,...

00:09.233 --> 00:10.846
...and now they obviously are.

00:11.021 --> 00:13.085
This was something that we'd never seen before.

00:13.178 --> 00:14.660
A new kind of problem.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.097
It's not just country versus country.

00:17.233 --> 00:19.540
All of us are somewhat on the front lines.

00:19.962 --> 00:24.929
It's their job 24/7 to try to break into places like Google.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.322
Hope is not a strategy.

00:30.878 --> 00:34.742
You need a team of professionals with exactly the right knowledge and expertise.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.063
That's mildly ominous.

00:42.061 --> 00:46.399
To do the kind of work we do, you need to cherry-pick the best of the best.

00:46.702 --> 00:49.456
I might qualify it by saying I'm an ethical hacker,...

00:49.567 --> 00:50.670
...but yes, let's say I'm a hacker.

00:50.806 --> 00:52.183
Definitely consider myself a hacker.

00:52.263 --> 00:52.607
Hacker.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.049
Hacker.

00:53.143 --> 00:55.458
I wear mostly hoodies for some reason.

00:56.653 --> 00:57.803
This is very serious.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.821
The attacker is after something and you want to find out what they're after.

01:04.037 --> 01:06.017
The attack happened over Christmas.

01:06.112 --> 01:07.927
Santa may arrive late this year.

01:08.285 --> 01:12.675
Someone is always rattling your doorknob to see if it's unlocked.

01:12.813 --> 01:14.667
We're constantly testing our products.

01:14.780 --> 01:18.149
Car companies crash their cars to make sure they're safe.

01:18.447 --> 01:19.126
So do we.

01:21.356 --> 01:23.047
So much more is at stake now.

01:23.153 --> 01:23.744
Human rights.

01:23.852 --> 01:24.550
Privacy.

01:24.639 --> 01:25.603
Professional life.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.485
Personal life.

01:26.599 --> 01:29.026
The entire ecosystem around an election.

01:29.142 --> 01:31.367
It's not just securing Google, it's securing the internet.

01:32.099 --> 01:34.364
I'm in this battle because I believe we can win.

01:34.709 --> 01:35.305
Hunt them down,...

01:35.433 --> 01:36.342
...contain them...

01:36.448 --> 01:37.317
...and then boot them out.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.105
Burn it down.

01:40.174 --> 01:46.920
If any attackers try to get in, I want them to have a very bad day.
