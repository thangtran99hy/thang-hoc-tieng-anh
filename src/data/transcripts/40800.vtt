00:00.767 --> 00:04.578
This is not only an important day; it is a very special day for us...

00:04.659 --> 00:07.866
...because it goes back to the year 1900...

00:07.971 --> 00:12.021
...when one of our founders, Charles Rolls, made a prophecy,...

00:12.109 --> 00:17.816
...and that prophecy was that electric drive is a perfect fit because it's clean,...

00:17.909 --> 00:23.449
...it's noiseless and once charging is able and is fixed of charging problem,...

00:23.527 --> 00:25.949
...then this is the ideal propulsion for a car.

00:26.457 --> 00:30.875
The reason why we went electric is that clients love it.

00:31.025 --> 00:35.982
Clients want to move emission-free in city centers in a Rolls-Royce.

00:36.075 --> 00:37.309
This is quite appealing.

00:37.417 --> 00:42.328
I think it is one jigsaw in a bigger puzzle of our long-term sustainability.

00:42.438 --> 00:46.721
So it's not meant to be "This washes now the brand in any way green."

00:46.957 --> 00:47.499
Not at all.
