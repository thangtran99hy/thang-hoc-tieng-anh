00:00.101 --> 00:02.939
Rishi Sunak is hours away from being sworn in...

00:03.013 --> 00:06.250
...as Britain's third prime minister in two months.

00:06.571 --> 00:10.355
The former chancellor represents an historic change in UK politics,...

00:10.677 --> 00:13.260
...becoming the first leader of Asian descent.

00:13.757 --> 00:16.089
He's also the first resident of Downing Street...

00:16.286 --> 00:18.705
...to be twice as rich as the King.

00:19.633 --> 00:22.944
At 42, Rishi Sunak is the youngest British prime minister...

00:23.038 --> 00:24.510
...in more than two centuries.

00:24.879 --> 00:27.670
Oxford educated, a career in finance.

00:27.807 --> 00:31.501
In many ways, the father of two represents the Tory establishment.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.672
But he is a significant break from the past.

00:34.984 --> 00:37.854
The first British prime minister of Indian background.

00:38.107 --> 00:40.099
The first who is a practicing Hindu.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.565
The fact that this is possible now, in 2022,...

00:43.708 --> 00:45.693
...is a new thing in British politics.

00:45.789 --> 00:48.139
That wouldn't have been the case even ten years ago,...

00:48.273 --> 00:50.264
...and certainly not 20 years ago.

00:50.457 --> 00:55.159
He's also likely to be the wealthiest person to call 10 Downing Street home.

00:55.779 --> 01:00.528
His wife, Akshata Murthy, is the daughter of one of India's richest men.

01:01.306 --> 01:05.899
The couple's net worth is put at more than 1.3 billion Australian dollars.

01:06.219 --> 01:09.813
Quite a rise for a man who only entered Parliament seven years ago.
