00:02.218 --> 00:06.435
So the haka, to me, it means a part of my cultural identity.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.435
It is a part of my customs, my traditions.

00:09.925 --> 00:13.903
And it was an important ceremonial dance...

00:13.975 --> 00:18.472
...that was passed down from my ancestors and we still practice it today.

00:28.407 --> 00:29.145
This is what I love.

00:29.381 --> 00:31.971
I love being able to show my culture off to the world.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.941
It's the only job in the world...

00:35.011 --> 00:37.715
...where you get to poke your tongue out at your customers...

00:38.012 --> 00:38.873
...and you get paid for it.

00:39.609 --> 00:41.345
Yeah, that's a good reason to do it, right?

00:41.529 --> 00:45.060
Very, very proud, actually, to be able to show our culture to the world...

00:45.218 --> 00:47.298
...and people like yourself embrace it.

00:47.521 --> 00:47.952
Yeah.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.154
They embrace our culture and they love it.

00:50.749 --> 00:53.580
And do you think you can do this your entire life?

00:53.699 --> 00:55.863
I'll keep on doing it as long as I can.

00:55.949 --> 00:58.442
As long as I can stomp my feet and do the haka.

01:00.953 --> 01:04.239
My grandparents were a part of that forbidden generation...

01:05.465 --> 01:07.763
...that weren't allowed to speak the language.

01:08.130 --> 01:11.289
And that came down to ignorance from the non-Maori...

01:11.371 --> 01:12.576
...that were around at the time...

01:13.293 --> 01:16.467
...who felt threatened by the language...

01:16.565 --> 01:18.859
...because they couldn't understand what our people were saying.

01:19.511 --> 01:20.815
They tried to outlaw.

01:20.928 --> 01:21.571
In fact, they did.

01:21.879 --> 01:27.771
They passed a law that forbid Maori to speak their native tongue...

01:28.251 --> 01:30.024
...and if they did speak the native tongue...

01:30.114 --> 01:31.963
...they were strapped for speaking the language.

01:32.671 --> 01:34.690
Because of that ignorance,...

01:34.942 --> 01:38.773
...it caused the whole language to miss an entire generation,...

01:38.889 --> 01:40.191
...which was my parents' generation.

01:41.127 --> 01:43.942
But in the past, I'd say past 20 years,...

01:44.124 --> 01:47.681
...a lot of work has been done to revive "Te Reo."

01:47.855 --> 01:53.432
We've got universities now providing Maori language courses...

01:53.613 --> 01:56.632
...to help with the revival of "Te Reo" Maori.
