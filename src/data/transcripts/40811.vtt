This is a message from New Zealand.

00:02.641 --> 00:08.274
If I could encourage the world to do one thing, it would be...

00:08.653 --> 00:09.925
It'd be pretty hard to explain.

00:10.243 --> 00:13.239
It would be to listen very carefully to each other.

00:13.455 --> 00:16.575
Take a look at what's going on around you...

00:16.657 --> 00:19.654
...and see if you can do something about it.

00:19.855 --> 00:21.925
If I could encourage the world to do one thing,...

00:22.039 --> 00:23.874
...it would be to stop polluting the Earth.

00:27.165 --> 00:28.379
Go to the library you know.

00:28.727 --> 00:29.680
Education is good.

00:29.989 --> 00:30.131
Yep.

00:30.488 --> 00:31.489
Live life to its fullest.

00:34.079 --> 00:35.740
Always be a good boy.

00:36.394 --> 00:37.965
It would be to stay positive.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.961
To know our neighbors and to be part of a community.

00:43.579 --> 00:48.238
To learn as much as you can about where you are in life.

00:49.144 --> 00:51.348
And look after our planet, a hell of a lot better.

00:51.615 --> 00:56.010
It might displode so that's why we always pick up rubbish.

00:56.126 --> 00:57.745
Get off your bum and go for a walk.

00:59.691 --> 01:00.593
Be honest.

01:01.090 --> 01:02.103
Tell me how you really feel.

01:03.175 --> 01:03.375
Yeah.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.429
Believe in yourself.

01:06.387 --> 01:09.337
Look up at the night sky on a clear, starry night...

01:09.459 --> 01:11.954
...and realize the universe that we're all part of.

01:12.361 --> 01:13.455
Stay safe.

01:13.655 --> 01:14.642
I love you, los amo.

01:15.683 --> 01:18.611
That we all just work together and be one.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.650
Anything is possible when you try.
