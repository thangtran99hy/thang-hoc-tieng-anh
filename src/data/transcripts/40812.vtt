00:00.233 --> 00:02.788
Let's bring you more now on what has been happening in Somalia.

00:02.900 --> 00:06.419
An extreme drought which our Africa correspondent, Andrew Harding,...

00:06.501 --> 00:07.975
…reported on two weeks ago.

00:08.436 --> 00:13.305
He's now returned to Somalia to see its impact in another part of the country.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.775
Now, Somalia has a long history of droughts...

00:15.875 --> 00:19.192
…but climate change has made the intervals between them shorter...

00:19.277 --> 00:22.373
…and the current one is the worst for 40 years.

00:22.449 --> 00:25.557
Let's show you what it looks like on this map...

00:25.663 --> 00:29.985
…which uses data from a USAID group that monitors famine.

00:30.067 --> 00:35.159
The areas that you see marked in orange there are classed as being in crisis...

00:35.376 --> 00:38.701
…and the red ones are classed as being one step worse...

00:38.813 --> 00:41.017
…being in emergency condition.

00:41.452 --> 00:45.575
And then there's an area which you can see marked in dark red on the map...

00:45.697 --> 00:51.041
…and that is where a full-blown famine is projected to begin within weeks.

00:51.123 --> 00:54.069
The definition of that is where households have no food,...

00:54.174 --> 00:59.765
…children suffer acute malnutrition, and people die every day from starvation.

00:59.973 --> 01:04.547
Now, Andrew's report that you're about to see comes from a place called Dolow.

01:04.995 --> 01:08.761
And that's where people have been coming in search of life-saving help.

01:09.007 --> 01:13.218
A warning that you are likely to find parts of it difficult to watch.

01:17.409 --> 01:23.541
From the parched plains of southern Somalia, a weary exodus.

01:25.351 --> 01:30.715
These families have trekked for days across a hostile wilderness in search of food.

01:31.624 --> 01:38.285
Tens of thousands have made similar journeys in recent weeks, drawn to places like this.

01:38.925 --> 01:43.850
The crowded outskirts of Dolow, a border town, where some help is at hand.

01:47.831 --> 01:51.262
The local hospital, funded by Britain since the last famine here...

01:51.487 --> 01:54.636
…back in 2011, is playing a vital role.

01:55.035 --> 01:58.465
The baby is really very severely malnourished.

02:01.605 --> 02:05.426
Pamela Wasonga, a nutrition expert from neighboring Kenya...

02:05.665 --> 02:07.422
...is afraid of what lies ahead.

02:08.179 --> 02:09.257
Somalia needs help.

02:09.611 --> 02:10.114
Now?

02:10.308 --> 02:10.851
Now.
