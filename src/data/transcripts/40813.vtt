On Click, we've seen digital supermodels carefully crafted over many months.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.731
And we've learned why designers want them.

00:13.196 --> 00:15.399
Digital models are going to become more and more in demand...

00:15.567 --> 00:19.141
...as it makes much more sense to put your 3D clothes on 3D models.

00:20.972 --> 00:25.505
Entirely digital fashion now often exists solely for social media.

00:27.179 --> 00:32.349
But the reality is physical clothing still results in about 100 million tons...

00:32.445 --> 00:35.527
...of waste every year and that's mostly because of customers...

00:35.618 --> 00:36.757
...sending things back.

00:37.137 --> 00:41.487
But now, one startup here in the heart of Amsterdam's fashion district...

00:41.567 --> 00:46.877
...is hoping to change that by using digital models to help online retailers...

00:47.089 --> 00:48.519
...clean up their act.

00:52.687 --> 00:55.326
This is Lalaland.

00:55.717 --> 01:02.143
Instead of painstakingly using CGI to create one or two digital supermodels...

01:02.446 --> 01:09.621
...it uses artificial intelligence that can make all kinds of digital bodies in minutes.

01:11.045 --> 01:13.953
Basically, we're going to have you configuring your own fashion model.

01:15.026 --> 01:19.155
Generating these synthetic models using artificial intelligence...

01:19.426 --> 01:24.538
...that then consumers can relate to more, which solves a massive problem...

01:24.680 --> 01:27.805
...of people feeling underrepresented while shopping online.

01:28.233 --> 01:31.765
The idea is that a retailer can make digital models...

01:31.853 --> 01:33.641
...they think shoppers will want to see,...

01:33.721 --> 01:39.890
...choosing skin tone, size, facial features, and hairstyles in just a click.

01:40.490 --> 01:45.621
So that's short, curly and we go to body shape.

01:45.717 --> 01:49.929
Yeah. Which we have apple, rectangle, pear, triangle.

01:51.393 --> 01:55.895
I've always had a nightmare myself, shopping, only seeing one type of complexion model.

01:56.158 --> 02:01.517
The closer the model is to you, the better idea you have of what the clothes...

02:01.598 --> 02:03.015
...will look like in reality.

02:03.145 --> 02:05.033
It's not just about colorizing...

02:05.125 --> 02:08.186
...or I'm trying to make someone look dark brown to light brown.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.674
It's really trying to take all characteristics...

02:10.755 --> 02:12.697
...that you would have with real humans, right?

02:12.900 --> 02:17.498
South Americans with bigger hips, maybe dark brown people with bigger lips.

02:18.426 --> 02:23.011
Shops then add garments, picking poses and fits.

02:24.489 --> 02:27.324
First, the before which was just the model.

02:27.451 --> 02:27.850
Wow.

02:27.927 --> 02:32.587
And the after, which is the model wearing your product items, in a couple of minutes.

02:32.671 --> 02:33.890
That's insane.
