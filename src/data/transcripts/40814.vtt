WEBVTT

00:00.159 --> 00:01.651
We use a lot of slang.

00:01.795 --> 00:03.699
Not gonna do it on camera, but we swear a lot as well.

00:03.806 --> 00:04.889
We just make words out of different words.

00:05.389 --> 00:08.333
I guess she can understand me because she's a Kiwi and it's very similar,...

00:08.421 --> 00:11.048
...but I don't think you would be able to understand a lot of my slang.

00:11.209 --> 00:11.577
I don't think so.

00:11.674 --> 00:12.995
Maybe a little.

00:13.233 --> 00:18.350
I've learned a lot, so I feel quite confident in my Aussie slang now.

00:18.523 --> 00:23.643
I was thinking the other day, Aussie is like 30 percent American, 30 percent UK and just 30 percent we made up.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.595
New Zealand and Australia, we adopt similar slang,...

00:26.937 --> 00:29.484
...but we always do have little arguments of like,...

00:30.295 --> 00:31.841
"Who created what?"

00:32.715 --> 00:35.214
You guys say pants, not underwear.

00:35.294 --> 00:38.682
And then, we say pants and you guys say trousers.

00:38.765 --> 00:40.049
Actually, we say pants.

00:40.126 --> 00:40.830
You guys say pants.

00:40.911 --> 00:41.716
You say trousers.

00:41.818 --> 00:42.525
I say trousers.

00:42.605 --> 00:47.333
We say pants because our pants like, this is pants, but for you it's underwear, right?

00:47.440 --> 00:48.302
We call them undies.

00:49.772 --> 00:51.408
I call them undies, too.

00:52.874 --> 00:55.523
In the US, we call them sneakers.

00:55.593 --> 00:57.113
Like "Oh, I want to get a pair of sneakers."

00:57.194 --> 00:58.191
Like "Oh, nice sneakers."

00:58.271 --> 01:00.824
Sometimes people have to say like "Oh, nice kicks you got there."

01:00.997 --> 01:02.146
Like that's a slang for it.

01:02.289 --> 01:02.968
Oh, nice kicks.

01:03.118 --> 01:04.959
In the UK, we call them trainers.

01:05.047 --> 01:05.309
Okay?

01:05.374 --> 01:10.831
So as a Kiwi, we literally, it depends on the shoe, but we say sneakers.

01:10.942 --> 01:11.879
We also say runners.

01:11.977 --> 01:13.896
We can also say trainers, depending on the shoe.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.157
Yeah.

01:14.239 --> 01:16.678
In Australia, there's 100% runners.

01:16.792 --> 01:19.584
In South Africa, we're a little bit similar to New Zealand.

01:19.727 --> 01:22.811
We can call them sneakers or takkies.

01:23.006 --> 01:23.602
Takkies.

01:24.185 --> 01:24.671
Takkies.

01:24.739 --> 01:25.391
So cute.

01:25.471 --> 01:26.859
I have no idea where it came from.

01:26.977 --> 01:29.197
When you're a kid, you're like "I want to get some new takkies."

01:30.613 --> 01:31.598
It's quite a cute word.

01:31.667 --> 01:32.554
I like it.

01:32.649 --> 01:34.950
I remember the first time I heard someone said trainers.

01:35.047 --> 01:36.571
They said like, "Oh, I've got to go get my trainers."

01:36.653 --> 01:39.193
I thought, "You have personal trainers?"

01:39.552 --> 01:39.909
What?
