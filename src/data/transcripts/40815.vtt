Let's take a look at this conversation between David and John.

00:07.101 --> 00:09.937
Do you know when Anna's birthday is?

00:10.529 --> 00:15.129
Can you help John to answer when Anna's birthday is?

00:15.283 --> 00:17.621
Pause the video and try to answer.

00:19.405 --> 00:20.265
Yes, I do.

00:20.715 --> 00:22.598
It's on January 26.

00:23.419 --> 00:25.261
She was born in winter.

00:25.905 --> 00:28.405
No, because she was born in Brazil.

00:28.977 --> 00:31.171
In January, it's summer in Brazil.

00:31.779 --> 00:33.463
Where were you born, John?

00:33.913 --> 00:35.657
I was born in my dad's farm.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.559
Isn't your dad's farm in Minas Gerais?

00:38.983 --> 00:40.435
Yes, it is.

00:40.643 --> 00:42.379
