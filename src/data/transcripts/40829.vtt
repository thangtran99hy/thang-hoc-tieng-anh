There's a desperate plea for global support to protect the world's animals and plants.

00:04.683 --> 00:06.436
It comes after a new report has shown...

00:06.509 --> 00:10.866
…that wildlife populations have fallen by nearly 70% since 1970.

00:11.437 --> 00:14.394
The Worldwide Fund For Nature says governments, businesses, and the public...

00:14.471 --> 00:17.608
…must take action to reverse the destruction of biodiversity.

00:17.991 --> 00:19.053
Sean Dilly reports.

00:20.933 --> 00:24.922
Striding with grace, content with its natural habitat in the Amazon.

00:25.270 --> 00:28.606
But maybe that's because this big cat doesn't understand the danger...

00:28.697 --> 00:30.073
…that lurks around the corner.

00:31.003 --> 00:33.904
The conservation charity, the Worldwide Fund For Nature...

00:34.161 --> 00:36.945
…says the breakup of natural habitat and climate change...

00:37.157 --> 00:40.439
…means animal populations here are in particular danger.

00:41.736 --> 00:46.607
The charity's latest Living Planet Report warns that global wildlife populations...

00:46.687 --> 00:49.885
…have fallen by nearly 70% in around 50 years.

00:51.383 --> 00:56.307
The study which assesses the abundance of almost 32,000 populations...

00:56.567 --> 01:03.173
..of 5,230 species of animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish around the world,...

01:03.495 --> 01:10.793
…suggests that population sizes declined by 69% on average between 1970 and 2018.

01:11.189 --> 01:16.495
Species living in freshwater lakes and wetlands have fallen by an average of 83%.

01:17.323 --> 01:21.174
The most impacted species live here in Latin America and the Amazon...

01:21.257 --> 01:25.586
…where deforestation is destroying trees and the species who rely on them...

01:25.819 --> 01:26.751
...to sustain life.

01:27.765 --> 01:33.019
Wildlife population sizes here have fallen by 94% over the past half century...

01:33.351 --> 01:34.609
…according to the report.

01:36.272 --> 01:41.212
Other areas such as North America, Asia, and Europe have seen a smaller decline,...

01:41.467 --> 01:44.057
…but climate change threatens species everywhere.

01:45.001 --> 01:48.909
The UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world,...

01:49.212 --> 01:51.787
…with just half of its nature richness remaining.

01:53.453 --> 01:55.599
The Worldwide Fund For Nature says...

01:55.687 --> 01:58.949
...it's now or never if we're to restore the natural world.

02:00.037 --> 02:04.183
The government says it's committed to halting the decline of nature by 2030,...

02:04.399 --> 02:07.408
…and that it will continue to improve on wildlife laws.

02:07.567 --> 02:10.783
But the WWF says it needs to act very quickly...

02:11.045 --> 02:15.001
…if it wants to protect species from danger and extinction.
