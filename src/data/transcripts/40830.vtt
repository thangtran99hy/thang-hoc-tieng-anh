Now, to a potential breakthrough in getting rid of plastic in the environment,...

00:04.484 --> 00:06.213
...researchers in Spain have found...

00:06.311 --> 00:10.127
...that saliva from the larvae of wax worms can break down...

00:10.213 --> 00:12.307
...some of the toughest types of plastic.

00:12.695 --> 00:14.150
Tom Brada has the details.

00:16.796 --> 00:21.641
Plastic pollution is one of the great environmental crises of our time.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.368
But could the humble worm potentially provide a solution?

00:27.195 --> 00:31.099
This specific worm you can see wriggling away is the wax worm,...

00:31.201 --> 00:35.698
...and Spanish researchers say they've discovered chemicals in the wax worm's drool,...

00:35.959 --> 00:40.820
...which can break down polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics in the world.

00:41.255 --> 00:46.794
Now, we found that the worms can do that through their saliva...

00:46.918 --> 00:48.941
...and in the saliva, there are two enzymes...

00:49.024 --> 00:52.481
...that can actually oxidize and then degrade polyethylene.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.786
According to the scientists who carried out the research,...

00:56.131 --> 00:59.430
...just one hour's exposure to the saliva can break down the plastic...

00:59.510 --> 01:01.914
...as effectively as years of weathering.

01:02.233 --> 01:03.517
And that could be crucial.

01:04.269 --> 01:08.451
Polyethylene is an extremely useful but durable material.

01:09.151 --> 01:14.073
First created in 1933, it's cheap to produce and doesn't interact with food.

01:14.297 --> 01:17.315
Which means it can be particularly useful for things like food packaging.

01:17.801 --> 01:20.321
But it can also be very hard to get rid of.

01:20.868 --> 01:23.393
The original concept of biodegration into the environment,...

01:23.476 --> 01:26.107
...you throw the plastic bags and then it degrades there.

01:26.399 --> 01:31.580
But I don't think it's feasible, it will all make much sense.

01:31.779 --> 01:36.157
So, in a controlled environment, waste management facility, bigger, smaller,...

01:36.291 --> 01:39.585
...whatever it is, you can imagine clearly we have to collect the plastic.

01:39.657 --> 01:42.842
Then, you can pour liters of the solution of this enzymes in there.

01:43.374 --> 01:46.302
Wax worms currently have a tricky reputation.

01:46.684 --> 01:48.902
They're actually considered pests by beekeepers...

01:49.027 --> 01:51.490
...as they feed on beeswax, pollen, and honey.

01:51.939 --> 01:55.136
But if they prove a useful weapon for tackling our plastic problems,...

01:55.385 --> 01:57.749
...then we might have to rethink their reputation.
