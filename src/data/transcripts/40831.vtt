They often say that in good times, people drink.

00:03.083 --> 00:03.886
And in bad times?

00:03.961 --> 00:06.089
Well, I guess people drink.

00:06.628 --> 00:11.741
At its simplest, it really is just barley, hops, yeast, and just water.

00:12.233 --> 00:17.391
But those four ingredients and a whole lot more, have increased quite a lot of late.

00:17.769 --> 00:21.614
Meaning that that is a little more expensive.

00:22.297 --> 00:25.961
Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in the world.

00:26.199 --> 00:30.220
It's a standing that has been boosted by the drink's relative affordability...

00:30.347 --> 00:33.077
...compared to cocktails or wine at a bar.

00:33.473 --> 00:38.804
But everyone from multinational brewers to small craft beer companies to pub chains...

00:38.937 --> 00:42.468
...has been warning about the beverage's inevitable price increase.

00:42.677 --> 00:46.399
In the United Kingdom, for instance, the average cost of a pint of beer...

00:46.486 --> 00:50.152
...has soared by 70% since the global financial crisis.

00:50.401 --> 00:59.724
The mean price for 568 milliliters of brew has gone from £2.30 in 2008 to £3.95 in 2022.

01:00.078 --> 01:02.873
The cheapest pint was found in a pub in Lancashire,...

01:02.960 --> 01:06.003
...in the northwest of England, at £1.79.

01:06.158 --> 01:07.046
The most expensive?

01:07.233 --> 01:09.608
London, of course, where one unnamed pub...

01:09.692 --> 01:13.553
...was charging a whopping £8.06 on average.

01:13.857 --> 01:16.995
But London is far from the priciest place to buy a beer.

01:17.264 --> 01:21.215
It's the seventh most expensive capital, according to one beer index,...

01:21.323 --> 01:26.178
...which analyzed the price of brew from local supermarkets and hotel lobbies.

01:26.393 --> 01:31.145
Tokyo, Bern, Paris, Beijing, Amman, and Doha,...

01:31.233 --> 01:34.139
...top the list of most expensive places to buy beer,...

01:34.233 --> 01:37.963
...with a pint costing nearly $20 in Qatar's capital.

01:38.419 --> 01:41.033
Why? The short answer is inflation.

01:41.286 --> 01:44.708
The long answer extends from the cost of raw materials...

01:44.869 --> 01:47.871
...to the wages of the bar staff pouring your pint.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.318
Just look at these charts released by Heineken, the second-largest brewer in the world.

01:53.535 --> 01:58.777
The costs of barley, aluminum, natural gas and paper are all going up,...

01:58.963 --> 02:02.344
...and Heineken told investors it’s protecting its bottom line...

02:02.431 --> 02:05.324
...by passing on those costs to consumers.
