00:00.050 --> 00:03.295
In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro is out as president,...

00:03.450 --> 00:06.428
...defeated by former president Lula da Silva.

00:06.567 --> 00:09.701
He defeated the incumbent Bolsonaro in a runoff election.

00:10.127 --> 00:13.223
Massive crowds in Sao Paulo are there celebrating.

00:13.291 --> 00:16.641
So far, 98.8% of votes have been tallied...

00:16.715 --> 00:20.405
...and da Silva leads 50.8% to 49.2.

00:20.967 --> 00:23.979
Da Silva served from 2003 to 2010...

00:24.076 --> 00:27.601
...and was then imprisoned in 2018 over a corruption scandal...

00:27.672 --> 00:29.967
...that sidelined him from that year's election...

00:30.033 --> 00:34.373
...and paved the way for Bolsonaro and four years of far-right politics.
