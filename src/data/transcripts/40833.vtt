In life, being focused helps us ignore distractions,...

00:04.097 --> 00:07.447
...but this focus can cause us to overlook unexpected opportunities.

00:07.827 --> 00:11.867
Similarly, when we focus our attention on finding a particular object,...

00:12.211 --> 00:14.817
...we often fail to notice other unexpected objects,...

00:15.082 --> 00:18.071
...a phenomenon referred to as inattentional blindness.

00:18.467 --> 00:21.075
Dr. Trafton Drew and research colleagues...

00:21.140 --> 00:23.539
...from the Visual Attention Lab at Harvard Medical School...

00:23.808 --> 00:26.290
...decided to examine if inattentional blindness...

00:26.417 --> 00:30.425
...also exists in the eyes of trained experts such as radiologists.

00:30.659 --> 00:33.574
In a recent study published in Psychological Science,...

00:33.719 --> 00:36.133
...Dr. Drew asked 24 radiologists...

00:36.323 --> 00:41.275
...to search for signs of lung cancer in 239 frames of a chest CT scan.

00:41.617 --> 00:45.064
In this stack of images, he inserted five consecutive frames...

00:45.154 --> 00:46.595
...containing an image of a gorilla.

00:46.976 --> 00:51.030
Despite superior ability of radiologists to detect lung cancer nodules,...

00:51.361 --> 00:55.446
...20 of the 24 radiologists did not report noticing the gorilla.

00:56.206 --> 00:59.759
Interestingly, eye tracking revealed that most of the radiologists...

00:59.873 --> 01:03.114
...who missed noticing the gorilla had looked directly at it.

01:03.398 --> 01:06.663
Looking right at something might not be enough to notice that it's there...

01:06.913 --> 01:08.335
...if you're looking for something else.

01:08.533 --> 01:12.922
This study suggests that even experts who routinely detect cancer nodules,...

01:13.119 --> 01:16.267
...which are about 48 times smaller than the image of the gorilla,...

01:16.432 --> 01:19.076
...are also susceptible to limitations of attention.

01:19.297 --> 01:21.076
By understanding these limitations,...

01:21.360 --> 01:24.860
...future research may help reduce errors committed by experts...

01:25.081 --> 01:27.664
...in diagnostic radiology, baggage screening,...

01:27.781 --> 01:30.711
...and many other professions that involve searching for items...

01:30.809 --> 01:32.085
...that are difficult to find.
