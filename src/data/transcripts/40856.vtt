You know, it says, "Out of Workshop" for a reason.

I'm so sorry to bother you, boss, but something has come up,...

00:11.633 --> 00:12.697
...and it's kind of a big deal.

00:12.839 --> 00:13.593
What is it?

00:13.705 --> 00:15.457
Have you ever heard of the World Cup?

00:16.212 --> 00:18.977
Well, they moved it to the holidays.

00:19.723 --> 00:19.915
Wait.

00:20.501 --> 00:23.343
The actual World Cup to the holiday season?

00:23.800 --> 00:24.406

00:24.566 --> 00:25.147
Sir, I know...

00:25.254 --> 00:26.738
You're telling me that they went ahead...

00:26.815 --> 00:29.481
...and moved the biggest sporting event on the planet...

00:29.691 --> 00:31.517
...right into the middle of my holiday season?

00:31.691 --> 00:31.941
Yeah.

00:32.135 --> 00:32.855
It's a big deal.

00:33.179 --> 00:34.717
There's Messi and Ronaldo.

00:34.859 --> 00:36.736
Yeah, but that's my time to shine.

00:36.821 --> 00:38.767
I mean, that guy has got like 300 million followers.

00:38.894 --> 00:40.352
How am I supposed to compete with that?

00:40.621 --> 00:42.308
I think it's like 400 million.

00:42.529 --> 00:43.369
400 million!

00:43.436 --> 00:44.005
Okay, great.

00:44.112 --> 00:44.369
You know what?

00:44.470 --> 00:45.788
Get Blitzen on the phone.

00:45.873 --> 00:46.848
I got to get on the next flight up there.

00:46.917 --> 00:47.635
We got work to do.

00:47.739 --> 00:48.299
Well, I...

00:49.383 --> 00:50.724
Oh, I gotta go, I gotta go.

00:50.914 --> 00:53.588
You know what? I got a turkey sandwich coming, you can have it.
