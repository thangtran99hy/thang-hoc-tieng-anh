Videos with the hashtag quiet quitting have racked up more than 150 million views...

00:17.069 --> 00:19.129
...on social media app, TikTok.

00:20.317 --> 00:24.363
The phrase gained momentum after a TikTok video was posted on the subject,...

00:24.451 --> 00:26.816
...by a software engineer in New York.

00:27.007 --> 00:29.559
I recently learned about this term called "quiet quitting,"...

00:29.635 --> 00:31.634
...where you're not outright quitting your job,...

00:31.710 --> 00:33.875
...but you're quitting the idea of going above and beyond.

00:34.065 --> 00:36.391
But this isn't just an American phenomenon.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.087
The rejection of hustle culture has been happening all around the world,...

00:40.210 --> 00:45.356
...including China, where the movement started long before it was popularized in the West.

00:47.281 --> 00:51.445
I talk with my friends, and they often use that term, like Tang Ping.

00:51.521 --> 00:57.421
"I really want to lie down and lie flat and I don't want to do my job."

00:57.719 --> 00:59.823
"I don't want to achieve something."

01:00.227 --> 01:03.541
It's more like people's attitudes towards their life.

01:03.657 --> 01:08.584
This is Dian Gu. He works as a content specialist for an internet company in China.

01:08.786 --> 01:12.851
Bai Lan is more like the definition of quiet quitting.

01:12.948 --> 01:18.901
People don't want to commit more to their jobs and they just do what the company require.

01:19.395 --> 01:23.566
So, these kind of phrases are really commonly used by me,...

01:23.652 --> 01:25.629
...by my friends, by younger people in China.

01:27.129 --> 01:32.651
The internet in China has been awash with the phrases "Tang Ping," which means "lying flat."

01:32.835 --> 01:36.035
And more recently, "Bai Lan," which means "let it rot."

01:36.477 --> 01:40.993
This has coincided with many young people in China becoming increasingly frustrated...

01:41.085 --> 01:44.183
...with both their personal and professional lives.

01:44.567 --> 01:49.311
Unlike most countries, China has continued to pursue a zero COVID strategy,...

01:49.473 --> 01:51.674
..which requires strict and sudden lockdowns...

01:51.779 --> 01:54.909
...and extensive testing for cities experiencing outbreaks,...

01:55.022 --> 01:58.355
...confining hundreds of millions of Chinese people to their homes.

01:58.511 --> 02:03.067
As a result, the country's economy has slowed down and is struggling to boost growth.

02:03.323 --> 02:08.153
The World Bank forecasts China  will grow just 2.8% in 2022,...

02:08.363 --> 02:13.587
...while the rest of the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow 5.3% on average.

02:13.841 --> 02:19.306
This is the first time China's GDP growth has lagged behind its neighbors since 1990.

02:19.604 --> 02:21.331
Amidst the economic uncertainty,...

02:21.427 --> 02:26.517
...youth unemployment in cities rose to almost 20% in July 2022.

02:26.623 --> 02:31.002
The highest since the Chinese government started publishing the figures in 2018.

02:31.180 --> 02:35.063
As a result, the labor market has shrunk since 2019.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.234
At the same time, the number of people entering higher education has grown...

02:39.317 --> 02:43.856
...rapidly over the past two decades, which means there is fierce competition...

02:43.930 --> 02:46.199
...between graduates for white collar jobs.
