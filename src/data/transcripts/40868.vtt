00:00.201 --> 00:03.466
Over the last few decades, the internet has evolved from a niche pastime...

00:03.567 --> 00:05.665
...to an essential part of our daily lives.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.487
But despite the technology's massive progress,...

00:08.567 --> 00:10.634
…critics say it's become too centralized,...

00:10.753 --> 00:14.261
…with power concentrated in the hands of a few big tech companies.

00:14.946 --> 00:19.484
Enter Web3, where a slew of companies, like the ones at this crypto conference,...

00:19.567 --> 00:21.557
…are aiming to reshape the internet.

00:22.331 --> 00:26.657
Proponents of Web3 say it has the potential to disrupt the giants of the tech world...

00:26.759 --> 00:30.007
...by giving power to internet users rather than platforms.

00:30.602 --> 00:34.355
But Web3's also drawn some prominent detractors, who've dismissed it as...

00:34.441 --> 00:38.505
…simply another Silicon Valley fad that creates more problems than it solves.

00:39.718 --> 00:43.542
So, what is Web3 exactly, and why can't the tech world stop talking about it?

00:50.444 --> 00:54.266
Web3 is a movement in tech that calls for the creation of a decentralized...

00:54.349 --> 00:59.049
…version of the internet based on a few technologies, with blockchain being a key one.

00:59.167 --> 01:03.511
Ethereum is currently the most popular platform on which Web3 services are built.

01:03.847 --> 01:06.650
But there are others, including Algorand and Polkadot.

01:07.062 --> 01:12.503
In fact, the term Web3 is thought to have been first coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood,...

01:12.694 --> 01:15.400
Polkadot's creator and a co-founder of Ethereum.

01:15.725 --> 01:23.787
Web3 is really sort of an alternative vision of the web where the services that we use...

01:24.029 --> 01:26.914
…are not hosted by a single service provider.

01:27.326 --> 01:30.542
To understand Web3 and where it's coming from, it's important to look a little...

01:30.622 --> 01:32.009
...at the history of the internet.

01:32.645 --> 01:37.130
During the 90s and early 2000s, websites were mostly static pages...

01:37.233 --> 01:39.422
...where you could consume pieces of information.

01:39.834 --> 01:42.265
But it was much harder to produce content of your own.

01:42.810 --> 01:45.011
This period has been described as Web1.

01:45.419 --> 01:50.419
With the advent of Web2 in the early to mid 2000s, we were introduced to applications...

01:50.491 --> 01:52.771
…like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.

01:53.468 --> 01:57.319
These sites were more interactive, allowing users to post their own material...

01:57.393 --> 02:01.440
…and engage in online discussions about everything from politics to pets.

02:02.065 --> 02:05.150
While Web2 ushered in a more user-friendly online experience,...

02:05.257 --> 02:07.457
…there were a few significant drawbacks.

02:07.821 --> 02:11.695
Bertrand Perez, chief operating officer at the Web3 Foundation,...

02:11.790 --> 02:13.543
…ran me through some of the downsides.

02:13.860 --> 02:18.458
Right now, you have big organizations who are controlling your data...

02:18.613 --> 02:21.469
…and providing you services that use your data.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.570
When you're using a service, if the service is free,...

02:24.859 --> 02:27.019
…that means that you are, you are the product.

02:27.195 --> 02:31.579
Those organizations are having a lot of insight on you, on your life, etc.

02:31.843 --> 02:33.050
And if you add that,...

02:33.136 --> 02:38.364
…together with artificial intelligence, you're able to basically know...

02:38.641 --> 02:44.363
…and kind of model, person per person, very precisely, and that's, to some extent,...

02:44.439 --> 02:46.685
…a level of freedom that you're giving away.

02:46.948 --> 02:51.760
Because the more those institutions know you, the better they can sell you ads.
