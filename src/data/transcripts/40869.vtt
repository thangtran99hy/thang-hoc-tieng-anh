00:00.050 --> 00:05.751
Wait, we all know that one person who just gets eaten alive by mosquitos.

00:06.175 --> 00:06.933
Maybe it's you.

00:07.655 --> 00:08.226
I'm one of them.

00:08.683 --> 00:11.506
But now we're learning more about why.

00:11.847 --> 00:16.033
A new study says it could have everything to do with how you smell.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.756
CNN's Tom Foreman is here to explain.

00:19.900 --> 00:25.255
I know there are a lot of people wondering why they're a mosquito magnet, Tom?

00:25.605 --> 00:29.675
Of course, this is really exciting research out of Rockefeller University...

00:29.761 --> 00:31.965
…up in New York where they do a lot of great work on this.

00:32.055 --> 00:37.403
What they have found is that skin odor has a definite attractiveness...

00:37.487 --> 00:39.961
...to mosquitoes in some people.

00:40.057 --> 00:40.850
How definite?

00:41.010 --> 00:45.126
So much so that in some cases, they say the people who attract the mosquitos...

00:45.211 --> 00:51.937
…are 100 times more attractive than other people nearby in that circumstance.

00:52.088 --> 00:54.229
Now, what is it about skin odor that makes the difference?

00:54.380 --> 00:57.717
They put these sleeves on people and then collected their skin odor...

00:57.807 --> 00:59.091
…and then tested them against mosquitos.

00:59.445 --> 01:04.183
And they found that what it was was a type of fatty acid called carboxylic acid.

01:04.283 --> 01:06.504
What do carboxylic acids do?

01:06.945 --> 01:10.477
Carboxylic acids really, really draw mosquitos.

01:10.567 --> 01:13.250
Only female mosquitos, by the way, male mosquitos do not bite.

01:13.628 --> 01:18.517
And they give a slight odor, these acids, of cheese and feet...

01:18.959 --> 01:21.151
…which doesn't sound that attractive to begin with.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.877
Even if the mosquitos aren't bothering you, you might have another problem.

01:24.131 --> 01:25.548
But, here's the thing, Anna.

01:25.984 --> 01:29.982
The mosquitos, they even try to say, what if we could somehow cut off the receptors...

01:30.303 --> 01:33.379
…on these mosquitos, so they couldn't really smell it as well.

01:33.567 --> 01:34.181
Didn't matter.

01:34.434 --> 01:35.397
They had backup systems.

01:35.493 --> 01:38.928
They still went after these people more than anybody else.

01:39.029 --> 01:40.183
So now, the question is,...

01:40.457 --> 01:44.379
…can you come up with some sort of a blocking lotion or something...

01:44.450 --> 01:48.720
…that people could put over their skin that would suppress this so, at very least,...

01:49.195 --> 01:52.259
…these people are not more attractive to mosquitos than anybody else.

01:52.341 --> 01:54.205
And maybe you can get to where they're not so attractive.

01:54.567 --> 01:58.838
Big important deal, because remember, mosquitos aside from just being a nuisance...

01:58.921 --> 01:59.850
…and being uncomfortable,...

02:00.115 --> 02:04.154
…700 million people per year suffer from mosquito borne diseases...

02:04.233 --> 02:06.633
…like Zika, and Dengue, and Malaria.

02:06.762 --> 02:07.858
So, this is big news.

02:07.935 --> 02:11.337
It may seem funny in a way, but in other ways, could be really important, Anna.
