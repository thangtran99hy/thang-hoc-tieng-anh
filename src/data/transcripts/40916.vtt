00:00.109 --> 00:03.329
The search for an RSV vaccine has taken decades.

00:03.421 --> 00:08.064
But tonight, Pfizer says new data for its experimental shot, given to pregnant women...

00:08.167 --> 00:09.534
...early in the third trimester,...

00:09.851 --> 00:14.115
...was 69% effective in preventing severe respiratory illnesses...

00:14.200 --> 00:16.839
...in newborns in their first six months of life.

00:17.115 --> 00:20.565
The company says it's even more effective in the first three months.

00:20.710 --> 00:21.981
It's a real breakthrough.

00:22.063 --> 00:26.797
I would say that people have been searching for a vaccine for nearly six decades,...

00:26.900 --> 00:29.179
...at least five without success.

00:29.270 --> 00:33.353
So, this is a major triumph for women and their babies.

00:33.490 --> 00:35.739
Pfizer's data has not yet been peer reviewed.

00:35.869 --> 00:40.100
The company says it plans to apply for vaccine approval before the end of this year.

00:40.356 --> 00:43.328
But shots in arms may not come until next winter.

00:43.531 --> 00:45.085
It's extremely frustrating.

00:45.417 --> 00:47.907
Irene Aaron in Baltimore knows the stakes.

00:48.023 --> 00:52.117
Two of her children with RSV have gone to the hospital in the past few weeks.

00:52.332 --> 00:56.578
I think the toughest part is not being able to do much,...

00:56.703 --> 00:59.352
...but just kind of wait and let it run its course.

00:59.505 --> 01:02.961
As more hospitals brace for a triple threat of RSV, the flu,...

01:03.051 --> 01:04.915
...and new Covid variants this winter,...

01:05.087 --> 01:08.327
...Orange County, California has just declared a health emergency.

01:08.613 --> 01:10.587
And another concern is emerging.

01:10.765 --> 01:13.526
Across the U.S., some pharmacies are reporting shortages...

01:13.596 --> 01:17.647
...of one of the most widely used antibiotics, liquid Amoxicillin.

01:17.900 --> 01:22.753
It's commonly prescribed to treat ear infections, pneumonia, and bronchitis in children.

01:22.972 --> 01:25.588
It's concerning because it's happening in a time of the year...

01:25.933 --> 01:27.568
...where the demand is increasing.

01:27.832 --> 01:30.774
It's not clear what's causing the shortage of the antibiotic...

01:30.862 --> 01:32.629
...or how long it could last.
