Today's lottery hopefuls have another slim chance at becoming a multimillionaire.

00:07.034 --> 00:13.071
Tonight's Powerball jackpot drawing has jumped to at least 825 million dollars.

00:13.418 --> 00:16.650
It's the second largest prize in Powerball history.

00:16.967 --> 00:20.547
No one has matched all six numbers since August 3rd.

00:20.885 --> 00:26.370
But, if you beat the one in 292 million odds of winning it all tonight,...

00:26.643 --> 00:29.317
...you can get your millions spread over 29 years...

00:29.389 --> 00:35.819
...or choose the cash out option which is worth an estimated 410 million dollars.

00:35.886 --> 00:37.323
So, you're saying there's a chance?

00:37.535 --> 00:40.117
There's always a chance if you play.

00:40.205 --> 00:41.073
Would you share?

00:41.737 --> 00:43.538
If we all pitch in.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.157
How much do you want me to share?

00:45.536 --> 00:46.239
A third.

00:46.643 --> 00:47.255
A third?

00:47.416 --> 00:48.796
You want me to give a third of the money?

00:49.115 --> 00:49.775
If we all pitch in.

00:49.918 --> 00:50.309
I don't know.
