With just 12 days to go to the start of the football World Cup in Qatar...

00:04.300 --> 00:08.004
…there are renewed doubts about the suitability of the Arab state...

00:08.089 --> 00:09.277
...to host the tournament.

00:09.797 --> 00:13.255
Now Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, football's governing body,...

00:13.592 --> 00:17.141
…said that he'd always been of the view that awarding the World Cup to Qatar...

00:17.382 --> 00:22.296
…had been a mistake, as the country was too small, he said, to host the event.

00:22.806 --> 00:27.493
And there's been worldwide criticism of remarks by Khalid Salman, a former Qatari...

00:27.575 --> 00:30.802
…professional footballer, now a World Cup Ambassador...

00:31.163 --> 00:34.989
…who said that homosexuality was "damage in the mind", in his words,...

00:35.431 --> 00:38.391
...and warned gay people that they would have to accept the country's rules...

00:38.567 --> 00:39.370
…when they visit it.

00:39.837 --> 00:44.626
Qatar has been consistently criticized for its stance on same-sex relationships,...

00:44.997 --> 00:48.517
…its record on human rights, and its treatment of migrant workers.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.474
Our sports correspondent, Jane Dougall, has this report.

00:52.261 --> 00:56.516
In Qatar, this could see you in prison or even given the death penalty.

00:57.192 --> 01:00.999
This protest is to pressure FIFA ahead of a World Cup in a country...

01:01.269 --> 01:03.811
…where same-sex relationships are illegal.

01:04.041 --> 01:08.255
And just days before the Tournament begins an ambassador for the World Cup,...

01:08.355 --> 01:13.419
…Khalid Salman, has told a German broadcaster that homosexuality is Haram,...

01:13.707 --> 01:18.603
…which means forbidden, but he went further, denouncing same-sex relationships.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.605
But do you think gay is Haram?

01:21.138 --> 01:21.695
It's Haram.

01:22.021 --> 01:23.349
Because, why is it Haram?

01:24.765 --> 01:27.588
I am not one big Muslim but, it's Haram. Why?

01:27.807 --> 01:29.168
Because it's damage in the mind.

01:29.866 --> 01:33.277
At this point, a World Cup official steps in to bring the interview...

01:33.359 --> 01:34.435
...to an abrupt halt.

01:35.385 --> 01:38.523
His words have upset many, including Helen Hardy,...

01:38.832 --> 01:42.100
…founder of LGBT football team, Manchester Laces.

01:42.417 --> 01:47.363
It was so definite and what was said, and so deeply offensive...

01:47.626 --> 01:50.043
…and I don't think it could be taken any other way...

01:50.128 --> 01:55.727
…so, we're quite clear on how they feel about LGBTQ+ people.
