00:00.679 --> 00:03.767
The first member of Gen Z has been elected to congress.

00:04.077 --> 00:08.867
At only 25 years old, Congressman-elect, Maxwell Alejandro-Frost,...

00:09.107 --> 00:11.328
...will represent Florida's tenth district.

00:11.843 --> 00:16.657
Frost first appeared on The Sunday Show last year to discuss his run,...

00:16.733 --> 00:19.695
...highlighting the importance of gun violence prevention.

00:20.479 --> 00:24.143
As he prepares to take office in January, his celebration began...

00:24.339 --> 00:26.129
...with a shout-out from President Biden.

00:27.633 --> 00:32.316
I was pleased to call Maxwell Frost, the 25-year-old who got elected,...

00:32.391 --> 00:35.611
...I guess, the youngest man ever elected to the United States Congress.

00:35.741 --> 00:38.117
I have no doubt he's off to an incredible start...

00:38.503 --> 00:41.271
...and what I'm sure will be a long, distinguished career.

00:43.832 --> 00:47.789
Earlier this morning, I spoke with Florida's new Congressman-elect.

00:50.033 --> 00:54.769
Congressman-elect, Maxwell Alejandro-Frost, welcome back to The Sunday Show.

00:54.851 --> 00:56.051
Of course, thank you for having me.

00:56.127 --> 00:58.802
How does it feel to hear that, Congressman-elect?

00:58.872 --> 01:00.878
I know, it's completely surreal.

01:00.951 --> 01:02.861
I feel incredibly blessed, humbled.

01:02.931 --> 01:04.769
I mean, I remember the election, my watch party,...

01:04.859 --> 01:07.775
...we had hundreds of our supporters around us and really,...

01:08.083 --> 01:10.156
...that's what i'm taking with me, just thinking of all those faces,...

01:10.227 --> 01:13.347
...everyone who put a lot on the line to make sure that we won this.

01:13.647 --> 01:16.806
So, you are part of what I call, The Parkland Generation.

01:16.883 --> 01:19.183
When I heard you were running for congress I said,...

01:19.414 --> 01:22.785
..."let's get him on television, let's hear what he has to say".

01:23.474 --> 01:24.779
And I'm just gonna claim credit,...

01:24.844 --> 01:28.360
...we were the first ones to put you on national television.

01:28.651 --> 01:30.332
And you impressed all of us.

01:30.395 --> 01:31.997
We kept inviting you back.

01:33.249 --> 01:36.583
Talk to us about the campaign, what it was like,...

01:36.667 --> 01:41.146
...now that you've run the race, you've won the race, the experience.

01:41.412 --> 01:43.705
Well, you know, we launched August 11th of last year.

01:43.773 --> 01:45.619
We've been doing this for over a year and a half.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.436
Or about a year and a half, it's been very difficult.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.120
There were a lot of trying times, a lot of hard decisions.

01:51.561 --> 01:53.111
But at the end of the day, like I said before,...

01:53.203 --> 01:54.605
...it is really about the team that we built.

01:54.677 --> 01:56.027
I mean, it was my name on the ballot,...

01:56.302 --> 01:58.742
...but it is really a whole movement of people in Central Florida,...

01:58.809 --> 02:01.742
...and really across the country that came together to make it happen.

02:02.075 --> 02:04.339
I'm happy election day, it has come and gone.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.243
I'm really excited to represent my community in congress.
