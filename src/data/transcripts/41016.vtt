The story of Hachioji Castle

00:05.846 --> 00:08.803
When and how was Hachioji Castle built?

00:11.995 --> 00:18.597
450 years ago, a lord named Hojo Ujiteru ruled Hachioji.

00:20.746 --> 00:25.474
He lived in Takiyama Castle, located on a gently sloping site.

00:26.667 --> 00:30.009
At that time, there were wars in many places,...

00:30.366 --> 00:33.364
...so he built a new castle in a better location.

00:34.299 --> 00:38.481
The new castle was built where the god Hachioji Gongen lives.

00:42.233 --> 00:45.477
It was named Hachioji Castle after the god.

00:46.567 --> 00:50.640
It was located in the steep mountains and was easy to defend.

00:55.233 --> 00:59.707
Moreover, Mt. Takao was close to Hachioji Castle.

01:00.609 --> 01:03.799
Mt. Takao also helped protect the castle.

01:06.977 --> 01:14.228
Izuna Daigongen, the god of battle at Yakuoin Temple on Mt. Takao, was worshipped.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.794
Therefore, he respected the mountain and the temple very much.
