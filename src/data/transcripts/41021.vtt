00:00.999 --> 00:03.123
It was, you know, one of the hardest calls that I've had to make...

00:03.189 --> 00:06.426
...in the 18 years of running the company.

00:06.879 --> 00:11.701
Company-wide announcements from tech CEOs have all had similarities recently.

00:11.963 --> 00:13.477
This is a very difficult decision.

00:13.570 --> 00:14.381
Tough decision.

00:14.551 --> 00:17.999
Amazon is preparing to lay off up to 10,000 workers.

00:18.347 --> 00:20.481
Meta is cutting 11,000.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.586
Netflix has made big cuts.

00:22.791 --> 00:25.929
So has Shopify, Snap, Twitter.

00:26.574 --> 00:28.811
Well, maybe that's a unique circumstance.

00:30.087 --> 00:33.909
Here are the macro and micro reasons why the tech industry...

00:34.049 --> 00:35.617
...is seeing massive layoffs right now.

00:37.061 --> 00:39.454
Picture it, Silicon Valley, 2019.

00:39.841 --> 00:43.101
These three major tech companies' revenues were growing steadily...

00:43.183 --> 00:44.661
...as everything moved online,...

00:45.109 --> 00:47.564
...and their number of employees was also growing.

00:48.086 --> 00:50.144
Then, of course, the pandemic hit.

00:50.576 --> 00:53.721
People began shopping from home, binge-watching,...

00:55.352 --> 00:57.797
...and just generally being online more.

00:58.043 --> 01:01.829
Not only did the revenues of many of these tech companies skyrocket,...

01:02.503 --> 01:04.171
...but so did their headcount.

01:05.003 --> 01:07.354
I think Amazon is the quintessential example here.

01:07.514 --> 01:09.023
If you're promising two-day shipping,...

01:09.289 --> 01:10.996
...you have to deliver two-day shipping.

01:11.149 --> 01:14.986
Amazon, in response, just had to hire many, many more people.

01:15.362 --> 01:18.113
Not only did Amazon grow its delivery operation,...

01:18.369 --> 01:20.839
...but it also grew from its web services.

01:21.384 --> 01:25.873
Companies and businesses that might not have been online before now...

01:25.973 --> 01:27.072
...had an online presence.

01:27.179 --> 01:28.907
You have to host that data somewhere.

01:29.102 --> 01:34.215
And so, Amazon saw their cloud computing service do very well during the pandemic.

01:34.589 --> 01:36.588
Revenues stayed high through 2021,...

01:36.737 --> 01:40.433
...and many tech CEOs thought the growth would continue at the same rate...

01:40.531 --> 01:42.385
...they had seen for the last two years.

01:42.899 --> 01:45.878
We're going to continue to invest aggressively...

01:46.230 --> 01:48.421
...into the growth opportunities that we see.

01:48.755 --> 01:52.805
So they continued the hiring spree, and not just a lot of employees,...

01:53.004 --> 01:55.277
...but some expensive employees...

01:55.662 --> 01:58.438
...because this is also when the talent wars ramped up,...

01:58.598 --> 02:01.218
...where companies were vying for in-demand employees.

02:01.609 --> 02:04.427
Facebook launching the Metaverse is a prime example.
