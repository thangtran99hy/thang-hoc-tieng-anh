Mt. Takao and the people of "So-to"

00:05.874 --> 00:10.671
Yakuoin Temple on Mt. Takao and the silk industry in Hachioji...

00:11.118 --> 00:12.939
...had a great influence on people.

00:13.333 --> 00:17.749
The material for silk is made by insects called silkworms.

00:18.128 --> 00:22.037
Therefore, silkworms were very important in the old days.

00:22.535 --> 00:26.163
People then came to Yakuoin for silkworm charms.

00:27.605 --> 00:33.542
During the Edo period, many people came to Hachioji-juku to get silkworm charms.

00:34.496 --> 00:37.726
They were given out to many people who worked with silk,...

00:38.026 --> 00:41.148
...and many people came to believe in the Yakuoin.

00:42.969 --> 00:48.724
After that, people planted young trees at Yakuoin to thank the temple for the charms.
