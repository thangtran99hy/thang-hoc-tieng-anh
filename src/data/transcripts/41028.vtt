00:00.050 --> 00:03.596
Taking a daily multivitamin could possibly be a health benefit...

00:03.673 --> 00:05.373
…not just for your body, but for your brain.

00:05.828 --> 00:08.569
A new study from the Alzheimer's Association suggests that...

00:08.932 --> 00:11.706
...it may slow cognitive decline in older adults.

00:11.777 --> 00:13.333
To help us understand this encouraging news,...

00:13.399 --> 00:16.699
...in regards to finding potential ways to combat Alzheimer's disease and Dementia.

00:17.094 --> 00:19.183
Let's bring in CNN's Dr. Tara Narula.

00:19.263 --> 00:21.224
Dr. Narula, tell us more about this new study.

00:21.362 --> 00:24.343
Yes, so this was a study of 2200 older Americans,...

00:24.413 --> 00:26.893
…over 65, average age about 72.

00:26.967 --> 00:29.368
And researchers wanted to see if they gave them a supplement,...

00:29.486 --> 00:32.379
…either a cocoa extract supplement or multivitamin,...

00:32.461 --> 00:34.238
…could they protect their cognitive function.

00:34.567 --> 00:38.093
So, they gave them a cognitive test at baseline and then after three years,...

00:38.175 --> 00:40.790
…they looked after three years, they would test them year one, two, and three.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.028
And essentially, they thought they might find...

00:43.122 --> 00:46.325
…a benefit with the cocoa extract group, but they did not.

00:46.415 --> 00:49.852
What they did find was a significant benefit in the multivitamin group.

00:50.233 --> 00:54.771
They found that it basically slowed the decline of cognitive aging by about 60%.

00:55.137 --> 00:56.064
In addition to that,...

00:56.163 --> 00:59.663
...in those patients or subjects that had underlying cardiovascular disease,...

00:59.774 --> 01:01.361
…they saw even more benefit.

01:01.655 --> 01:03.625
So, people seem really excited about this.

01:03.717 --> 01:08.030
Why, other than the obvious reasons, why do you think it is so interesting?

01:08.265 --> 01:11.799
Well, prior reviews of nutrition supplements have really shown...

01:11.900 --> 01:14.741
...insufficient evidence to recommend that to protect cognitive function.

01:14.834 --> 01:18.477
So, this is kind of the first large-scale, what we call randomized control trial,...

01:18.567 --> 01:21.423
…of high-quality study to show a potential benefit.

01:21.606 --> 01:25.353
There is no FDA approved interventions for older asymptomatic adults...

01:25.437 --> 01:26.614
...to protect cognitive function.

01:26.866 --> 01:29.183
So, when you think of the potential public health impact...

01:29.264 --> 01:33.509
…of something as simple as a multivitamin that's safe, accessible, affordable.

01:33.791 --> 01:37.523
If it really is effective, you could have the potential to help millions of Americans.

01:37.605 --> 01:41.227
We know that six and a half millions of Americans have Alzheimer's disease.

01:41.490 --> 01:44.704
When you look worldwide, we're talking about 46 million adults...

01:45.141 --> 01:48.041
…who suffer from Alzheimer's, Dementia, or some form of Dementia.

01:48.127 --> 01:49.338
So, real potential.

01:49.431 --> 01:51.075
So, what are the takeaways?

01:51.154 --> 01:55.539
What should people at home be doing right now, because they're watching us?

01:55.719 --> 01:59.098
Well, it's important to emphasize, this is not practiced or guideline changing yet.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.442
This is definitely preliminary.

02:00.567 --> 02:01.275
Just one study?

02:01.382 --> 02:04.123
One study, important to replicate it in larger studies.

02:04.201 --> 02:06.025
Studies with a more diverse population.

02:06.689 --> 02:10.951
And what we really counsel people for in general is to eat a well-balanced diet, right?

02:11.043 --> 02:15.330
There's tons of bioactive nutrients in a good diet and you can get them that way.

02:15.631 --> 02:18.298
There are certain populations that certainly need supplementation...

02:18.500 --> 02:21.431
…and then there are other low-cost strategies that you can do...

02:21.520 --> 02:22.799
...to improve your cognitive function.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.032
Things like exercise, things like managing your stress, sleep,...

02:26.135 --> 02:30.800
…avoiding too much alcohol or cigarettes, social stimulation, mental stimulation.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.407
So, these are easy strategies to use.
