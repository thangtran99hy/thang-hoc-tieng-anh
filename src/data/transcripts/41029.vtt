Here in Gothenburg, one team are trying to solve this,...

00:06.794 --> 00:10.673
...and they're using technology that's a bit like a 3D printer.

00:11.058 --> 00:14.161
Their aim, well, is to grow organs from cells...

00:14.293 --> 00:16.959
...here in this lab, no donor necessary.

00:19.090 --> 00:23.517
Today, we are going to look at printing skin.

00:23.799 --> 00:26.217
The skin is composed of different layers.

00:26.567 --> 00:26.941
Okay.

00:27.021 --> 00:30.799
And every layer has different types of cells in combination.

00:31.872 --> 00:34.726
It is the human body's largest organ...

00:35.069 --> 00:38.999
...but even a small skin model requires millions of cells.

00:39.413 --> 00:42.850
They're mixed into different bio-inks for the machine to choose between.

00:43.925 --> 00:49.634
You really design a code that tells the printer what to print,...

00:49.734 --> 00:52.025
...when, and then, which structure.

00:54.336 --> 00:57.480
It's a lot more visible than I expected with the naked eye.

00:58.381 --> 01:02.180
A hollow blood vessel structure has been layered inside this one...

01:02.501 --> 01:05.463
...and a syringe-like print head has a different purpose.

01:05.969 --> 01:10.891
So you can actually print cells or hair follicles to really replicate the skin.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.262
At this stage it kind of looks like a bit of toothpaste,...

01:14.343 --> 01:17.517
...but actually it's seriously complicated cells in here.

01:19.781 --> 01:25.298
While 3D printed skin could be applied in surgical grafts, drug, and cosmetic testing,...

01:25.617 --> 01:27.575
...the cells have to mature first.

01:28.071 --> 01:30.613
This is where we culture the samples we've printed.

01:31.789 --> 01:34.481
They are kept in incubators for several weeks...

01:34.866 --> 01:36.721
...and this tray is about a week old.

01:37.334 --> 01:41.015
The top part, which is mimicking the top of our skin, is on top.

01:41.949 --> 01:47.433
A mix of proteins and nutrient molecules is fed in and the waste is removed,...

01:47.628 --> 01:49.596
...all while being closely monitored.

01:50.015 --> 01:53.503
The beauty with this microscope is you can actually watch your sample...

01:53.866 --> 01:58.763
...through an iPad so it's no longer looking through those small eye things.

01:59.831 --> 02:02.930
Green dots for living cells, red for dead.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.382
So there's not that many dead cells here that you can see.

02:05.488 --> 02:06.909
Which is a very good sign.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.785
Close analysis of the end results is needed to fine-tune.

02:11.195 --> 02:13.806
Cell ink has been printing cancer tumors...

02:14.001 --> 02:16.789
...so that patients could receive personalized treatments...

02:17.025 --> 02:19.573
...without enduring drug trials themselves.

02:20.597 --> 02:23.835
They've also made liver models for drug screening campaigns...

02:24.192 --> 02:27.593
...and are helping beauty brands become animal cruelty-free,...

02:27.955 --> 02:30.359
...thanks to testing on lab-grown skin.
