Now, scientists in the UK have discovered that bumblebees...

00:03.053 --> 00:06.354
...enjoy playing with balls just as humans and dogs do.

00:06.679 --> 00:09.904
Researchers at Queen Mary University in London say the research...

00:09.986 --> 00:12.622
...which was published in the journal, Animal Behavior,...

00:12.981 --> 00:17.009
...provides a strong indication that insect minds are far more sophisticated...

00:17.097 --> 00:18.127
...than we might have imagined.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.061
Aruna Iyengar has this report.

00:21.609 --> 00:23.479
It's an extraordinary sight.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.462
A bee plays with a ball.

00:26.324 --> 00:27.887
It's more than just cute,...

00:28.056 --> 00:30.850
...researchers say this shows for the first time,...

00:31.152 --> 00:35.312
...insects interacting with inanimate objects as a form of play,...

00:35.953 --> 00:40.311
...and that suggests their minds are more complex than we previously thought.

00:42.233 --> 00:44.873
These are known to work cooperatively in hives.

00:45.137 --> 00:47.029
They give us honey and wax,...

00:47.117 --> 00:50.039
...and our ecosystem relies on them through pollination.

00:50.631 --> 00:53.185
But despite their tiny size and brains,...

00:53.408 --> 00:56.437
...they're far from being just nature's workhorses.

00:56.796 --> 01:01.098
A team at Queen Mary University of London designed a series of experiments...

01:01.181 --> 01:03.434
...where bees rolled wooden balls.

01:04.043 --> 01:08.812
They found the bees showed their playful side without any extra inducement,...

01:08.982 --> 01:10.409
...like a sugary treat.

01:10.900 --> 01:14.087
They went back to the toys again and again.

01:14.697 --> 01:17.297
Younger bees played more than older ones,...

01:17.629 --> 01:22.138
...and adult males rolled for longer than females of a similar age.
