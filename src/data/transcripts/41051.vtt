00:03.707 --> 00:05.364
As a woman in my field,...

00:05.551 --> 00:10.337
...it wasn't always so easy to pursue my dream of becoming a scientist,...

00:10.633 --> 00:12.223
...but I followed my own path.

00:12.533 --> 00:14.256
Growing up in Japan,...

00:14.607 --> 00:19.462
...I was taught to have a strong sense of compassion and empathy for others,...

00:19.807 --> 00:23.915
...and this value is central to my work as an epidemiologist.

00:24.365 --> 00:28.709
In the past few years, I have been working at fighting COVID-19.

00:28.889 --> 00:34.293
I'm proud of my work to help prevent the spread of diseases on a global scale.

00:35.341 --> 00:38.519
I'm really glad to see that the Japanese government...

00:38.590 --> 00:41.411
...is committed to supporting women in science...

00:41.529 --> 00:44.303
...and funding more research at the university level,...

00:44.730 --> 00:47.579
...and I look forward to seeing even more women...

00:47.747 --> 00:50.005
...following their interest in science.
