The skies of Hawaii's Big Island turned a hellish bright red on Sunday...

00:05.149 --> 00:08.235
...as the world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa,...

00:08.351 --> 00:10.062
...began erupting for the first time...

00:10.147 --> 00:14.965
...since 1984, ending its longest quiet period in recorded history.

00:15.492 --> 00:20.053
The U.S. Geological Service says for now, the lava is contained within the summit,...

00:20.189 --> 00:23.667
...but they have warned residents that volcanic gases and fine ash...

00:23.799 --> 00:25.034
...may drift their way.

00:25.724 --> 00:28.723
Some areas of the Big Island were under an ashfall advisory...

00:28.837 --> 00:31.037
...issued by the National Weather Service.

00:31.494 --> 00:37.033
Mauna Loa rises 13,679 feet above the Pacific Ocean.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.577
It's part of the chain of volcanoes that form the islands of Hawaii.

00:41.114 --> 00:44.747
It last erupted in March and April of 1984,...

00:44.842 --> 00:49.286
...sending a flow of lava within five miles of the island's largest city.

00:50.117 --> 00:53.097

00:53.170 --> 00:56.329
