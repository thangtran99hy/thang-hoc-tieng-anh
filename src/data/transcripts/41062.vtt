00:00.050 --> 00:01.943
As we honor those who've served this country,...

00:02.035 --> 00:04.331
...one group is enlisting shelter dogs...

00:04.567 --> 00:07.433
...to provide comfort and healing to veterans in need.

00:09.272 --> 00:11.831
Rescue dogs on a mission to save lives,...

00:12.071 --> 00:15.253
…all through the California non-profit, Shelter to Soldier.

00:15.511 --> 00:20.039
We aim to adopt dogs and give them a purpose in life,...

00:20.132 --> 00:22.528
…while also helping save veterans' lives.

00:22.728 --> 00:27.078
Post-9/11 veterans battling mental health conditions are paired at no charge,...

00:27.145 --> 00:31.345
...with dogs who have received specialized instruction over 12 to 18 months...

00:31.589 --> 00:33.767
...to become psychiatric service animals.

00:33.987 --> 00:35.216
The need is great.

00:35.367 --> 00:39.722
85% of our veterans suffer from nightmares and night terrors,...

00:39.812 --> 00:43.600
...so we have a bedroom in our task room to help practice those interruptions...

00:43.682 --> 00:44.811
…with our dogs for their rest.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.831
Trainers not only teach the dogs basic commands, but how to comfort.

00:49.185 --> 00:53.145
They help veterans like Adam Cunningham, a marine who served in Afghanistan.

00:53.282 --> 00:56.991
After getting out, I just felt like I didn't have any real options, I guess.

00:57.100 --> 01:03.111
During this time, I just felt so hopeless, helpless, lost.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.491
I felt like I was just slowly suffocating.

01:05.621 --> 01:09.393
But Adam's life turning around when he met Bash, a lab mix...

01:09.567 --> 01:10.783
…through Shelter to Soldier.

01:11.493 --> 01:15.321
Bash came in the room, he was kind of like, looked over, walked up to me...

01:15.567 --> 01:16.319
…and then hopped up.

01:17.056 --> 01:20.192
And then was just like, "Hey, I'm here like, what's going on man?"

01:20.355 --> 01:24.583
The organization living up to its motto, "Saving two lives at a time."

01:24.735 --> 01:27.139
After experiencing the brotherhood of the military,...

01:27.490 --> 01:32.309
...after experiencing losing best friends, the relationship I have with Bash is...

01:32.485 --> 01:35.843
…it's almost like you're taking the best out of all those categories,...

01:36.062 --> 01:37.465
…wrapping it up in a dog.

01:38.013 --> 01:38.811
It's priceless.

01:39.861 --> 01:41.048
That's a special bond.

01:41.398 --> 01:44.009
And to all of the veterans out there, we are truly grateful...

01:44.085 --> 01:46.002
…for your service and sacrifice.
