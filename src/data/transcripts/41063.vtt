00:00.175 --> 00:01.855
It's a staggeringly close call...

00:01.938 --> 00:06.873
…when charging e-bikes suddenly catch fire nearly engulfing a young child in its fury.

00:06.962 --> 00:09.301
It's like a blowtorch, where fire everywhere.

00:09.438 --> 00:13.305
As so-called micromobility devices, like e-scooters and e-bikes...

00:13.379 --> 00:15.629
…have exploded in popularity nationwide,...

00:15.928 --> 00:18.257
...so have the number of injuries involving them.

00:18.420 --> 00:21.048
And officials say, problems have been flaring up more...

00:21.131 --> 00:24.668
…during the charging of the highly flammable lithium-ion batteries.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.809
It looks like a really powerful firework.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.571
Mauricio Orosco says all it took was a single faulty battery...

00:30.918 --> 00:32.390
...to demolish his bike shop.

00:32.669 --> 00:35.491
All the cells from the battery went everywhere in the shop,...

00:36.233 --> 00:38.021
...so the explosion was really really hard.

00:38.233 --> 00:41.165
An e-bike battery was blamed for this blaze, too.

00:41.403 --> 00:44.820
Forcing daring rope rescues from a 20th story window.

00:44.963 --> 00:48.042
Here in New York, the increase in incidents is especially pronounced,...

00:48.134 --> 00:51.893
...as commuters and food delivery workers alike, lean on the devices...

00:52.075 --> 00:54.440
...to help crisscross the busy city streets.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.215
So far this year, lithium-ion batteries have sparked...

00:57.291 --> 00:59.599
…nearly 200 fires in New York City,...

00:59.945 --> 01:02.749
…injuring more people than the last three years combined.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.157
Does that make you nervous at all?

01:04.346 --> 01:05.318
Yeah, sure, of course.

01:06.106 --> 01:08.653
Of course the battery, I have to pay attention with the battery.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.305
And while officials consider policies regulating refurbished batteries,...

01:12.531 --> 01:14.974
…many acknowledge e-bikes are here to stay.

01:15.233 --> 01:18.832
Reminding riders never charge the battery unattended or overnight.

01:19.092 --> 01:21.760
If the battery appears damaged, stop using it.

01:21.938 --> 01:26.319
And most importantly, only use the charging equipment made for your device.

01:26.661 --> 01:30.767
As fire officials try to steer the statistics in a safer direction.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.645
