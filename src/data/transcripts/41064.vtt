Now, on to something that's been all over the news in recent weeks,...

00:03.607 --> 00:05.649
...Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter.

00:05.781 --> 00:09.243
Yeah, his takeover hasn't been without issues, shall we say,...

00:09.399 --> 00:13.983
...from charging for verification, to laying off half of the social media site staff.

00:14.104 --> 00:14.878
As a result,...

00:14.970 --> 00:20.692
...millions of Twitter users are exploring another little-known platform called Mastodon.

00:20.974 --> 00:24.176
Our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman, gives us the low-down.

00:28.288 --> 00:31.381
It gets its name from a prehistoric elephant...

00:33.641 --> 00:37.997
...and shares it with a heavy metal band.

00:40.516 --> 00:45.724
Yes, Mastodon, an alternative to Twitter that's exploded in popularity lately.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.593
The first thing you have to do when you sign up is choose a server.

00:50.819 --> 00:51.693
There are loads of them,...

00:51.771 --> 00:55.447
...and they're themed by things like country, city, interests.

00:55.540 --> 00:59.115
You've got UK, Glasgow, gaming, and so on.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.817
It doesn't really matter which one you choose...

01:00.900 --> 01:02.373
...because you can see all the others anyway,...

01:02.652 --> 01:05.355
...but it gives you a sort of starting community of people...

01:05.433 --> 01:08.006
...who are more likely to be sharing the same sort of stuff...

01:08.091 --> 01:09.971
...that you're interested in as well.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.370
By the way, you don't tweet here, you Toot.

01:14.602 --> 01:18.161
One of the attractions of this platform is that it's decentralized.

01:18.425 --> 01:21.414
No one person or company owns Mastodon.

01:21.751 --> 01:25.040
The staffers all link up to form a kind of collective network,...

01:25.233 --> 01:28.471
...but they're all owned by individuals and different organizations.

01:28.807 --> 01:32.429
This does mean that you can be at the whim of whoever owns your server.

01:32.662 --> 01:35.100
If that goes down, so does your account.

01:35.414 --> 01:37.405
You can switch servers if you want to.

01:37.711 --> 01:39.792
But people are saying that it's quite a faff.

01:40.502 --> 01:42.455
There's also the issue of moderation.

01:42.567 --> 01:46.850
Because it's not centrally run, Mastodon moderation differs from server to server.

01:47.123 --> 01:48.709
Some have rules, some have none.

01:48.989 --> 01:53.637
It's free to use, but some of the hosts ask for donations because they don't get paid.
