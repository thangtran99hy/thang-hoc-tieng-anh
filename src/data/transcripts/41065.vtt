I read a lot of science fiction when I was young,...

00:07.858 --> 00:10.686
...so people like Clark and Asimov and Heinlein.

00:10.935 --> 00:13.865
Most of the books Heinlein wrote were pretty straightforward,...

00:14.245 --> 00:16.291
...aimed at a pretty young audience.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.632
And so, I read all of those.

00:18.767 --> 00:22.761
Then he wrote a couple where he wasn't aiming them at kids at all.

00:22.837 --> 00:26.282
They were actually representing more of his overall philosophy of life...

00:26.412 --> 00:28.505
...and concerns that he had.

00:28.779 --> 00:33.119
So both "Stranger in a Strange Land" and "Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"...

00:33.324 --> 00:36.460
...were so different than what he'd written before...

00:36.545 --> 00:41.597
...where "Stranger in a Strange Land" is so much more complicated than the other ones.

00:41.883 --> 00:44.479
It has somebody raised on Mars...

00:44.617 --> 00:47.399
...who hasn't been exposed to normal human society...

00:47.699 --> 00:50.657
...and he almost becomes like a religious figure,...

00:50.760 --> 00:54.627
...sort of figuring out a new sense of human purpose and religion.

00:54.740 --> 00:56.455
These books were supposed to help you...

00:56.541 --> 00:58.479
...think about how things worked in the real world.

00:58.756 --> 01:01.911
The word "grok," I think, was first used in that book...

01:02.017 --> 01:03.552
...and that seemed kind of cool...

01:03.689 --> 01:07.668
...and it had some liberal, almost hippie-type moral values.

01:07.790 --> 01:10.828
This is the late 60s, early 70s.

01:10.965 --> 01:14.652
They had kind of this truth telling, justice idea.

01:14.980 --> 01:16.562
So it's kind of subversive.

01:16.662 --> 01:21.672
It's a pretty profound book, especially when you've read all those other books...

01:21.771 --> 01:23.521
...that you could just kind of plow through...

01:23.581 --> 01:25.628
...and you knew who the hero was and the bad guy was.

01:25.781 --> 01:29.697
The endings were always kind of tidy, which in this case,...

01:29.869 --> 01:31.223
..."Stranger in a Strange Land,"...

01:31.409 --> 01:32.819
...the end is not that tidy.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.564
You kind of don't know what to think.

01:34.938 --> 01:36.356
The author is kind of telling you,...

01:36.486 --> 01:39.886
..."Hey, the future of humanity is pretty unclear as well."
