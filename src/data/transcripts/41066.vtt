00:00.564 --> 00:06.163
Korea reaches the knockout stage after dramatic victory over formidable Portugal.

00:06.945 --> 00:11.793
Until the second half, World Cup's final Group H match was dragging on to a draw.

00:12.124 --> 00:16.001
If the game ends this way, Korea won't be qualified to the next round...

00:16.300 --> 00:19.082
...with its record of two draws and one loss.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.350
However, a miracle happened during the added time.

00:23.330 --> 00:27.763
What seems like a draw ended up a victory with Huang's last-minute goal.

00:27.989 --> 00:31.467
Korea won the game, but their fate was yet to be determined.

00:32.989 --> 00:37.778
In the other Group H match, Uruguay was still leading Ghana 2 to 0.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.129
Everyone waited nervously.

00:43.904 --> 00:47.918
Even the players gathered in the middle of the field to watch the game on their phone.

00:48.623 --> 00:51.625
Korea's fate is now up to Uruguay and Ghana.

00:52.007 --> 00:54.059
If Uruguay were to score another goal,...

00:54.183 --> 00:56.313
...South Korea would be out of the World Cup.

00:57.149 --> 01:02.342
Korea was barely ahead of Uruguay with one win, one draw and one loss.

01:02.586 --> 01:05.705
Both teams were tied on points and goal difference as well.

01:06.309 --> 01:08.407
However, having scored four goals,...

01:08.554 --> 01:11.556
...South Korea was able to make it to the next round.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.533
Finishing in second place in Group H,...

01:14.603 --> 01:17.115
...South Korea is to face Brazil in the next round,...

01:17.233 --> 01:19.918
...the country ranking first in FIFA world rankings...

01:20.157 --> 01:23.781
...and one of the strongest candidates to win the World Cup.

01:23.947 --> 01:26.165
South Korea may fall behind in ranking,...

01:26.251 --> 01:28.661
...but we hope for another miracle nonetheless.
