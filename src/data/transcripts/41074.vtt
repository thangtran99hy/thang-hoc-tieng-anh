My parents moved to Rome when I was a baby.

00:07.335 --> 00:11.854
So for me, the first memories of my life are linked to Rome.

00:12.289 --> 00:14.195
I lived there for almost 20 years.

00:14.272 --> 00:19.523
Therefore, this is what influenced a lot my character and my view of the world.

00:21.185 --> 00:25.262
I went to German school in Rome, in the center of Rome.

00:25.506 --> 00:29.209
I went to kindergarten, elementary school and also high school.

00:29.289 --> 00:33.411
So all my career and school was done in the same place.

00:34.270 --> 00:42.999
When I lived in Rome, I felt and acted like being part of all of this.

00:43.099 --> 00:46.087
And now I feel much more like somebody...

00:46.183 --> 00:49.804
...who is watching the things from outside the Ponte Sisto,...

00:49.920 --> 00:56.281
...even Via Giulia, Piazza Navona, Campo de Fiori for us was a daily routine.

00:56.543 --> 00:59.005
So now I realize even more today...

00:59.223 --> 01:05.070
...how this way of living was influencing my way of looking at things...

01:05.160 --> 01:06.648
...without knowing at that time.

01:06.743 --> 01:12.083
So it was part of my life and I was not really taking too much attention,...

01:12.191 --> 01:16.163
...even if we were into history and we were aware of what we saw.

01:17.439 --> 01:22.572
Piazza Navona gives me special memories because we always met there at night...

01:22.649 --> 01:26.469
...and it was always the starting point for our walks through the city.

01:26.977 --> 01:29.237
The Giardino degli Aranci is a special place for me...

01:29.309 --> 01:34.553
...because I went there when we had motorbikes in our teens,...

01:34.690 --> 01:37.489
...spending quite some time overviewing Rome.

01:37.603 --> 01:43.719
It's one spot which I think is very remarkable and unique and it awakes memories.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.486
Rome always feels like home.
