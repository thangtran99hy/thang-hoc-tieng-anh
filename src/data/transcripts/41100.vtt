Tonight, meet the Thompsons and the Moraleses,...

00:02.961 --> 00:05.917
...two families who are extra grateful this Thanksgiving.

00:06.165 --> 00:08.749
Debbie Thompson and Chris Morales have been best friends...

00:08.817 --> 00:11.043
...since elementary school in Westminster, California.

00:11.181 --> 00:13.594
Inseparable, cheerleading together in high school.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.142
We got married a year apart.

00:16.302 --> 00:18.267
Yeah, we've just done everything together.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.850
It's just, we're as one.

00:20.984 --> 00:21.492
For sure.

00:21.865 --> 00:25.050
In 2015, Chris received the devastating news...

00:25.131 --> 00:26.053
...that she needed a kidney.

00:26.299 --> 00:27.977
Her best friend didn't hesitate.

00:28.424 --> 00:29.373
I said, "Well, you can have mine".

00:29.567 --> 00:31.808
I mean, it was never even a thought.

00:34.206 --> 00:36.845
She'd make a full recovery and is now healthy.

00:37.094 --> 00:39.889
But what happened next, neither couple could have imagined.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.424
Seven years later, Chris's husband, Ron, was in renal failure...

00:43.630 --> 00:45.297
...and now he needed a kidney, too.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.119
He was in the emergency room, and we just couldn't believe it...

00:48.233 --> 00:49.547
...because I already went through kidney failure,...

00:49.621 --> 00:51.273
...and then now he's going through kidney failure.

00:51.728 --> 00:54.078
Then the call from their friends, the Thompsons,...

00:54.262 --> 00:55.890
...that would change their lives again.

00:56.224 --> 00:59.755
He says, "Do you need a kidney?" And it took me a couple of seconds...

00:59.921 --> 01:03.943
...because I was in awe, and I was like, "Well, yeah, you know, I do".

01:04.634 --> 01:05.698
Look at you, Joe.

01:06.084 --> 01:08.965
Ron's surgery, just like his wife's, was a success.

01:09.119 --> 01:11.092
Both were at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.823
Words can't explain how I feel.

01:18.567 --> 01:21.405
I want to let him know that I'll always be there for him...

01:21.787 --> 01:23.150
...for what he's done for me.

01:24.492 --> 01:26.732
Tonight, the Moraleses, grateful.

01:27.181 --> 01:30.032
This Thanksgiving week, we're so grateful and happy,...

01:30.136 --> 01:34.850
...and we just, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you Debbie and Brian,...

01:35.233 --> 01:36.202
...for the gift of life.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.435
Debbie and Brian, going above and beyond, quite the gift.
