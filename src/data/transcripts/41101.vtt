It's a case that's been going through the courts for two years.

00:05.823 --> 00:07.894
The advocacy group Make It Happen...

00:08.014 --> 00:12.827
…wants the voting age in New Zealand lowered to include 16 and 17 year olds.

00:13.175 --> 00:14.573
And the courts have agreed.

00:14.977 --> 00:17.765
The New Zealand Supreme Court declared the current law...

00:17.850 --> 00:20.879
…that prevents voting for teenagers is inconsistent...

00:20.954 --> 00:24.387
…with the Bill of Rights and it's backed by the Prime Minister.

00:24.675 --> 00:27.337
I personally support a decrease in the voting age,...

00:27.441 --> 00:30.864
...but it is not a matter simply for me or even the government.

00:31.045 --> 00:33.575
Any change in electoral law of this nature...

00:33.900 --> 00:37.631
…requires 75% of parliamentarian support.

00:37.849 --> 00:41.285
That's why it's our view that this is an issue best placed to Parliament...

00:41.567 --> 00:42.909
…for everyone to have their say.

00:43.098 --> 00:45.905
Only a few countries allow those under 18 to vote.

00:46.185 --> 00:49.287
Brazil, Cuba, Austria, and Malta to name some.

00:49.701 --> 00:53.209
But many across the world are arguing that young people should have a say...

00:53.294 --> 00:55.897
…on long-term democratic decisions,...

00:56.283 --> 00:58.591
…given they will have to live with the consequences.

00:59.201 --> 01:01.881
Brexit in the UK, is one example.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.112
Young people are not a monolithic group.

01:04.233 --> 01:07.040
Different young people will have different opinions on different issues.

01:07.351 --> 01:09.715
But we've seen global trends and what we know...

01:09.936 --> 01:13.183
...is that young people are deeply concerned about long-term issues.

01:13.317 --> 01:16.781
I think nowadays, that kids these days are getting more progressive...

01:16.870 --> 01:19.618
...and that it would be a good idea to have a younger voting age.

01:19.692 --> 01:20.807
I think everyone should be able to vote,...

01:21.233 --> 01:25.794
…but when I was 16 I didn't have enough knowledge to make a decent decision, no.

01:26.307 --> 01:28.469
The legislation will have a tough road ahead.

01:28.973 --> 01:34.139
75% support in Parliament would require the backing of both Ardern's Labor Party...

01:34.267 --> 01:37.319
…and the opposition, National Party, to become law.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.625
The National Party so far, opposed the plan.

01:41.528 --> 01:45.283
If approved, it won't happen by the next New Zealand general election...

01:45.671 --> 01:49.399
…that's due to take place sometime before January 2024.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.601
