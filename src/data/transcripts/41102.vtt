00:01.797 --> 00:05.637
Cranking up the volume is putting more than a billion 12 to 34 year olds...

00:05.733 --> 00:07.119
...at risk of hearing loss.

00:07.496 --> 00:11.083
Researchers shared their analysis of data from 2000 to 2021...

00:11.158 --> 00:14.749
…on unsafe listening practices in the British Medical Journal.

00:15.188 --> 00:18.295
Listening to headphones or going to a concert or even a restaurant...

00:18.396 --> 00:23.677
…where the volume was too loud for too long could cause irreversible damage.

00:24.213 --> 00:27.443
They will come in complaining about persistent ringing in their ears,...

00:27.521 --> 00:29.132
…but their hearing test looks normal...

00:29.734 --> 00:32.381
…and then once we retest them over several years,...

00:32.459 --> 00:34.460
…we'll notice that hearing has dropped off.

00:34.786 --> 00:36.599
So how loud is too loud?

00:37.104 --> 00:41.974
85 decibels sounds like a blender, 100 decibels sounds like a subway train,...

00:42.268 --> 00:46.184
...120 decibels sounds like a concert or a siren.

00:46.900 --> 00:51.729
The loud sounds, essentially trauma, damage hair sensory cells in the cochlea,...

00:52.031 --> 00:54.703
…the snail looking part deep in your skull, in the inner ear.

00:54.951 --> 00:58.517
The hair cells die, there is no way of getting them back.

00:58.799 --> 01:04.284
The CDC says 85 decibels over a 40 hour work week is the max safe limit.

01:04.641 --> 01:09.146
The BMJ study found just 2.5 hours of 92 decibels could do damage.

01:09.315 --> 01:13.035
Otolaryngologist, Dr. Landon Duyka, was not involved in the study.

01:13.306 --> 01:17.124
He tells Newsy that noise exposure trauma is a sliding scale.

01:17.465 --> 01:20.791
And sometimes you can have one episode of noise exposure...

01:20.871 --> 01:24.183
...that is so intense that even that one episode...

01:24.251 --> 01:26.821
...can lead to lifelong hearing loss.

01:27.602 --> 01:29.307
And just in time for holiday traveling,...

01:29.394 --> 01:33.765
...Doctor Dylan Chan with the University of California, San Francisco offers this.

01:33.871 --> 01:36.843
There's a whole lot of great headphones out there...

01:36.923 --> 01:40.622
...that actually have hard limits to the volume that they can produce.

01:40.769 --> 01:43.430
And they're actually capped up at 85 decibels,...

01:43.808 --> 01:46.419
...which is the sort of limit of safe hearing.

01:46.776 --> 01:48.465
Lindsay Feast, Newsy.
