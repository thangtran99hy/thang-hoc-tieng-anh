00:02.619 --> 00:07.013
Explorers, adventurers, scientists.

00:07.387 --> 00:10.972
The ones who always broadened our horizons.

00:11.522 --> 00:16.461
We were at their side when they reached the deepest point in the oceans,...

00:17.173 --> 00:21.210
...the highest summits of the Earth and both poles.

00:21.679 --> 00:24.051
We may think we've seen it all,...

00:24.236 --> 00:26.766
...but the world has its limits after all.

00:27.371 --> 00:32.441
But why do explorers, adventurers, scientists...

00:32.692 --> 00:36.434
...continue to venture out there again and again?

00:37.685 --> 00:40.081
Certainly not just for the record.

00:41.181 --> 00:43.753
So what do they seek, really?

00:45.196 --> 00:49.857
To understand more intimately how complex and delicate our planet is.

00:50.601 --> 00:55.040
To document its change and how we can affect it for the better.

00:55.944 --> 01:00.529
As long as they need it, we will be at their side.

01:01.617 --> 01:07.131
Because today, the real discovery is not so much about finding new lands,...

01:07.602 --> 01:12.355
...it's about looking with new eyes at the marvels of our planet,...

01:13.155 --> 01:15.322
...rekindling our sense of wonder...

01:15.736 --> 01:24.681
...and acting here and now to preserve this pale blue dot and make it perpetual.
