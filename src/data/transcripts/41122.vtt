00:00.139 --> 00:01.894
Teams playing in the World Cup...

00:01.973 --> 00:05.941
...are vying for fame, glory, and the thrill of victory.

00:08.595 --> 00:13.077
Aside from all that stuff, the champion team also gets a trophy like this.

00:13.370 --> 00:17.249
It's one of the most coveted prizes in the world, and it's made here,...

00:17.333 --> 00:21.435
...in a humble building on the outskirts of the Italian city of Milan.

00:23.652 --> 00:26.295
That's the headquarters of GDE Bertoni,...

00:26.535 --> 00:30.313
...a small family firm that's been crafting the trophies for 50 years.

00:30.589 --> 00:34.329
The FIFA World Cup trophy depicts two figures holding the world...

00:34.760 --> 00:36.869
...or is that a ball aloft?

00:37.109 --> 00:40.113
It was designed by Bertoni's artistic director,...

00:40.208 --> 00:44.690
...a sculptor named Sylvio Gazzaniga, back in 1971.

00:45.135 --> 00:50.557
The 14-inch tall, 18-karat gold prize has the winning country engraved in its base.

00:51.031 --> 00:52.805
France is the most recent name.

00:55.307 --> 00:57.522
On December 18th, the world will watch...

00:57.603 --> 01:00.757
...to see who will be the next name added to the trophy.

01:01.055 --> 01:04.247
Oh, and the winners don't actually get the original trophy.

01:04.433 --> 01:09.995
They have to settle for a gold-plated bronze replica that Bertoni's craftspeople prepare.
