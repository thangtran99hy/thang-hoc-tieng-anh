Hey, what's up?

00:00.616 --> 00:04.501
It's Tetris with Billboard News and I'm chilling with NCT 127.

00:04.559 --> 00:05.269
What's up, guys?

00:11.670 --> 00:13.423
Now, I love I saw online already.

00:13.573 --> 00:16.357
You guys landed at LAX, and your fans were there greeting you,...

00:16.441 --> 00:17.113
...giving you gifts.

00:17.255 --> 00:19.830
How does that feel to get that welcome when you get to town?

00:19.937 --> 00:20.736
It feels great.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.203
I mean, it's been a while.

00:23.347 --> 00:25.931
It's been a long, long time since we came to LA...

00:26.011 --> 00:27.677
...and they were there waiting.

00:27.759 --> 00:28.871
It was very heartwarming.

00:28.980 --> 00:29.785
It matched the weather.

00:29.979 --> 00:31.615
Oh, I like that.

00:31.747 --> 00:32.389
It matched the weather.

00:32.547 --> 00:33.977
Why do you feel like your return to the U.S....

00:34.063 --> 00:34.589
...is so epic?

00:34.763 --> 00:36.515
You know, we haven't seen our fans in three years,...

00:36.637 --> 00:39.864
...and throughout that time, we did come out with a lot more music,...

00:39.943 --> 00:44.110
...and we just can't wait to show our performances in front of our fans,...

00:44.890 --> 00:45.871
...and it has that much more meaning.

00:50.853 --> 00:53.315
You guys have been touring already  before you came to the States.

00:53.475 --> 00:55.485
Tell me about the tour so far and what's been your favorite part.

00:55.691 --> 01:01.621
So far, the tour is great as it used to be, and since the quarantine,...

01:01.748 --> 01:04.177
...it's been a long time meeting our fans face to face.

01:04.281 --> 01:07.473
But throughout the tour, we're meeting our fans all around the world.

01:07.615 --> 01:11.290
So we're so excited just doing the tour and meeting our fans.
