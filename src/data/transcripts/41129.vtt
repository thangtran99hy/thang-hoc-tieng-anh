Hello.

00:01.785 --> 00:05.945
My name is Choi Seung-hyun, also known as T.O.P, from South Korea.

00:06.833 --> 00:08.353
I'm 35 years old.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.081
I'm a magician, actor and art collector.

00:12.849 --> 00:17.157
I'm so honored to be a crew member of the dearMoon space project.

00:18.300 --> 00:22.764
I have always fantasized about space and the moon since I was young.

00:23.627 --> 00:29.675
I applied to dearMoon because I want to feel new stimulation and enlightenment.

00:30.731 --> 00:36.071
When I was told that I was chosen as a crew, I was so happy.

00:36.379 --> 00:38.330
Well, nice to see you again.

00:42.136 --> 00:43.396
Congratulations.

00:43.675 --> 00:47.187
MZ has been like a brother to me over the years.

00:48.409 --> 00:52.872
He's an entrepreneur and adventurer who I admire.

00:54.245 --> 01:01.923
Also, MZ inspires me as an art collector and gives me a lot of advice for my life.

01:03.537 --> 01:05.537
As a Korean citizen and artist,...

01:05.718 --> 01:11.654
...I feel great pride and responsibility in becoming the first Korean civilian...

01:11.777 --> 01:15.578
...going to the moon and representing my country.

01:16.677 --> 01:20.926
For this project, I want to support my dearMoon crew members.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.133
When I finally see the moon close up,...

01:25.139 --> 01:29.288
...I look forward to my personal growth and returning to Earth...

01:29.737 --> 01:32.489
...as an artist with new inspiration.
