Caroline Smith, she's head of Research Sciences Collections...

00:03.121 --> 00:04.807
...at the Natural History Museum, London.

00:04.881 --> 00:09.450
Okay, so news from Mars, not just that water was there...

00:09.754 --> 00:12.583
…perhaps millions of years ago, but also these organic compounds.

00:12.667 --> 00:16.362
Can you explain the importance of that discovery and how much more likely,...

00:16.433 --> 00:20.068
…if you believe so, that that makes it that there was life on Mars at some time.

00:21.436 --> 00:22.143
Yeah, of course.

00:22.219 --> 00:25.781
So, what we found with data that's come back from the Rover,...

00:25.863 --> 00:27.741
…and has been studied over the last few months,...

00:28.153 --> 00:30.348
...is that we see igneous rocks.

00:30.433 --> 00:33.994
So, these are rocks that have been formed through volcanic processes...

00:34.380 --> 00:37.827
…which have also been affected by the action of liquid water.

00:37.915 --> 00:40.267
And that's really, really interesting and exciting...

00:40.605 --> 00:44.679
…because liquid water is one of the key ingredients you need for life to start.

00:44.763 --> 00:47.896
So, if you've got the chances of life ever being on Mars,...

00:48.167 --> 00:52.277
…you'd need to have somewhere that had liquid water for at least a period of time.

00:52.355 --> 00:53.911
And we've got good evidence for that.

00:54.433 --> 00:59.789
Now, that's combined with the fact that we're seeing, using instruments like SHERLOC,...

00:59.867 --> 01:01.865
…which is an instrument that I'm involved with,...

01:02.149 --> 01:04.682
...also, the presence of organic molecules.

01:04.767 --> 01:08.517
And organic molecules are molecules, chemical molecules,...

01:08.793 --> 01:12.987
…made of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,...

01:13.084 --> 01:17.517
…sometimes with some sulfur, sometimes phosphorus, and maybe some added up things.

01:17.900 --> 01:21.875
And those are really, really important because you need organic molecules...

01:21.979 --> 01:23.049
…for life to start.

01:23.361 --> 01:26.251
And the other thing that's really interesting about organic molecules...

01:26.319 --> 01:29.399
...is they can actually be fossil evidence...

01:29.491 --> 01:32.517
…sort of fossil chemical evidence of potential past life.

01:32.900 --> 01:37.913
Now, it's very important to say that the organic molecules we found so far...

01:38.205 --> 01:43.445
…we cannot conclusively say, or even guess that those are evidence of past life.

01:43.815 --> 01:45.850
To be able to do those types of experiments,...

01:45.919 --> 01:50.282
…we need to do really detailed experiments on labs, in labs on Earth,...

01:50.383 --> 01:52.379
…which we hope to do in the 2030s...

01:52.669 --> 01:55.203
…when we hope that these samples will be returned from Mars.
