00:00.799 --> 00:06.645
The European Space Agency has chosen the British paralympic sprinter, John McFall,...

00:07.051 --> 00:11.143
...as the first astronaut with a disability to join the space training team.

00:11.515 --> 00:16.014
He'll work with designers and engineers to see if it's possible for him to go into space.

00:16.331 --> 00:18.981
Our science editor, Rebecca Morelle, reports.

00:20.436 --> 00:24.661
It's the job of dreams with an office that's got spectacular views...

00:24.915 --> 00:27.539
...offering an out of this world experience.

00:28.049 --> 00:31.479
Many would love to be an astronaut, but very few make the cut.

00:33.097 --> 00:35.945
Now in Paris, the European Space Agency has added...

00:36.027 --> 00:37.937
...some new names to the roll of honor.

00:38.471 --> 00:44.675
Selected from more than 22,000 applicants, this is the astronaut class of 2022.

00:46.049 --> 00:49.477
But for the first time ESA is widening its pool of talent...

00:49.667 --> 00:52.687
...by recruiting the first ever para-astronaut.

00:53.298 --> 00:58.894
I think being an amputee, being an astronaut was never really on my radar.

00:59.314 --> 01:01.679
John McFall is a paralympian sprinter.

01:01.987 --> 01:06.014
His right leg was amputated above the knee after a motorbike accident.

01:06.261 --> 01:11.005
He's been selected using exactly the same criteria as all European astronauts.

01:11.233 --> 01:13.231
The only difference is he has a disability.

01:13.418 --> 01:17.078
I thought I would have the skills and mix of skills and scientific background...

01:17.567 --> 01:22.258
...that I could really help them answer this very aspirational question...

01:22.349 --> 01:27.122
...of "Can we get someone with a physical disability into space,...

01:27.233 --> 01:28.432
...to work in space safely?"

01:29.114 --> 01:31.857
All astronauts have to undergo rigorous training.

01:32.287 --> 01:36.764
Part of John's job will be to test how the kits like spacesuits and spacecraft...

01:36.846 --> 01:37.873
...need to be adapted.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.399
His selection doesn't mean he'll definitely get to go into space,...

01:41.613 --> 01:43.992
...but he still wants to pave the way to make it happen.
