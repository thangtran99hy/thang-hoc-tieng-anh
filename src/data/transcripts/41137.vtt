00:00.050 --> 00:04.095
The unrest sweeping across China as citizens rise up in mass protests...

00:04.182 --> 00:05.821
...against severe Covid restrictions.

00:06.096 --> 00:08.466
Some are now calling for China's president to step down.

00:08.757 --> 00:09.787
Maggie Rulli has the story.

00:09.862 --> 00:11.875
Maggie, this is unprecedented.

00:13.877 --> 00:14.980
Yeah, Amy, exactly.

00:15.055 --> 00:19.226
These are on a nationwide scale that we haven't seen for decades...

00:19.307 --> 00:22.568
...and some now even calling for the Chinese leader to step down.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.250
This morning the biggest wave of unrest to hit mainland China in decades...

00:28.341 --> 00:29.967
...is ripping across the country.

00:33.943 --> 00:36.919
Fed up with the government's strict zero Covid policies,...

00:37.027 --> 00:40.484
...thousands have taken to the streets from Shanghai to Beijing...

00:40.900 --> 00:43.321
...and at dozens of universities across the country,...

00:45.143 --> 00:49.719
...shouting, "We want democratic rule of law, we want freedom of speech."

00:50.151 --> 00:54.100
Many holding up blank pieces of paper, the symbol of the growing movement...

00:54.189 --> 00:56.790
...designed to avoid arrest and call out censorship...

00:57.025 --> 00:58.628
...as they protest the lockdowns.

00:58.831 --> 01:03.022
And some in Shanghai calling for the country's president, Xi Jinping, to step down.

01:05.273 --> 01:09.433
A rare and brazen act of public defiance against the communist government...

01:09.829 --> 01:12.814
...and on a nationwide scale not seen across China,...

01:12.900 --> 01:16.369
...since the days of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.

01:16.608 --> 01:19.487
The protest triggered by a deadly apartment fire last week...

01:19.567 --> 01:22.147
...in the western city of Urumqi, killing ten.

01:22.537 --> 01:26.266
Many blaming Covid restrictions for the fire department's slow response time,...

01:26.643 --> 01:28.661
...something the Chinese government denies.
