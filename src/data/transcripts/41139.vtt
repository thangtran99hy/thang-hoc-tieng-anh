00:00.029 --> 00:01.790
Let's learn fractions.

00:02.801 --> 00:06.805
Understanding fractions can be easy as one-two-three.

00:07.150 --> 00:11.137
Just watch this video and you'll be using fractions with ease.

00:11.824 --> 00:17.444
It's easy to count whole things like a pizza, a pie or a donut.

00:17.983 --> 00:20.102
But what if we only had part of one?

00:20.677 --> 00:22.100
How would we count it then?

00:24.349 --> 00:26.177
We'd use fractions.

00:27.421 --> 00:29.424
A fraction looks like this.

00:30.738 --> 00:33.636
The bottom number is called the denominator.

00:33.801 --> 00:37.835
It shows how many equal pieces an object has been divided into.

00:38.082 --> 00:40.625
The top number is called the numerator.

00:41.061 --> 00:44.365
It shows how many parts of the denominator you are looking at.

00:46.215 --> 00:51.893
For example, a pizza is usually divided into eight slices.

00:52.189 --> 00:56.204
That means that in a fraction, the denominator would be eight.

00:57.959 --> 01:00.801
If you normally eat one slice of pizza,...

01:00.876 --> 01:03.257
...then one would be the numerator.

01:03.437 --> 01:06.865
That means that you eat one 8th of a pizza.

01:08.263 --> 01:11.065
If you normally eat two slices of pizza,...

01:11.192 --> 01:13.200
...then two would be the numerator.

01:13.337 --> 01:15.105
The denominator would still be eight.

01:15.237 --> 01:17.829
Since there are always eight slices of pizza,...

01:18.525 --> 01:22.245
...that would mean that you eat two eighths of a pizza.

01:23.592 --> 01:25.593
Let's try another example.

01:25.925 --> 01:30.787
This pie is divided into six pieces and you eat four pieces of it.

01:31.416 --> 01:34.509
If there were six pieces of pie and you eat four,...

01:34.755 --> 01:37.501
...what is the denominator of your fraction?

01:40.245 --> 01:41.979
That's right, six.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.073
What is the numerator?

01:47.541 --> 01:49.200
Yep, it's four.

01:50.073 --> 01:52.671
That means you ate four sixths of the pie.
