I just published my Year Ahead 2023 letter,...

00:03.490 --> 00:07.455
...looking at what's going to happen in the next 12 months and beyond.

00:07.715 --> 00:08.605
Life is changing.

00:08.683 --> 00:10.705
I'm about to become a grandfather.

00:11.089 --> 00:15.657
I reflect on the challenges we have right now with climate change getting worse,...

00:15.797 --> 00:18.989
...the Ukraine war, tough economic cycle,...

00:19.265 --> 00:23.943
...but it's hopefully uplifting because I also share great innovations.

00:24.133 --> 00:32.049
A great example is gene therapy could cure HIV; an AI-powered ultrasound machine...

00:32.381 --> 00:35.378
...that will help save lives of moms and newborns;...

00:35.812 --> 00:40.293
...climate technologies that will make it so the emissions from buildings...

00:40.514 --> 00:42.468
...go down quite dramatically.

00:43.037 --> 00:48.419
I'm excited that we can get back, making progress on tough issues.

00:48.611 --> 00:50.575
I hope you'll take a few minutes to read...

00:50.730 --> 00:55.817
...why I think we can make the future a lot better than the past.
