00:00.050 --> 00:01.860
Topping our world lead, police flooded the streets...

00:01.946 --> 00:05.210
...to crush a remarkable uprising in major Chinese cities last night,...

00:05.287 --> 00:08.093
…fueled by the country's strict COVID policies.

00:08.192 --> 00:12.217
Rare dissent over the ruling party and severe Chinese government censorship.

00:12.723 --> 00:15.205
On Monday, police in Shanghai ordered citizens...

00:15.293 --> 00:18.631
...to delete any photos or videos of the protests.

00:18.707 --> 00:20.977
They even took subway passengers' phones,...

00:21.053 --> 00:24.615
…apparently, deleting social media apps such as the popular WeChat,...

00:24.756 --> 00:27.610
…which is already heavily censored by Chinese authorities.

00:27.937 --> 00:30.571
Let's go right to CNN's Selina Wang in Beijing, China, for us, Selina.

00:30.784 --> 00:33.729
In some cases, police are even going further than that.

00:36.329 --> 00:39.904
Yeah, there are even reports from protesters that police have visited their homes.

00:39.971 --> 00:43.191
I mean, China, here they're using its playbook of repression, surveillance,...

00:43.251 --> 00:45.149
…individual intimidation tactics.

00:45.469 --> 00:47.156
And also police flooding the places...

00:47.233 --> 00:49.200
…where protests have broken out in recent days...

00:49.466 --> 00:51.219
…and proactively going to any places...

00:51.292 --> 00:53.345
…where potential future protests are planned...

00:53.565 --> 00:55.316
...in order to stop them from ever happening.

00:55.537 --> 00:57.907
I was at the protests in Beijing this week...

00:58.073 --> 01:00.815
…when I went back to the exact same location the following day.

01:00.899 --> 01:05.312
It was eerily quiet with masses of police cars as far as the eye could see.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.526
And what is chilling here, Jake, is that some of this intimidation...

01:08.823 --> 01:12.488
…playing out in broad daylight in massive metropolitan cities.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.559
Police randomly stopping people walking around where protests broke out in Shanghai.

01:16.633 --> 01:20.709
You can see in the video they're ordering people to delete content from their phones.

01:20.967 --> 01:24.359
There are other videos that appear to show police randomly checking the cell phones...

01:24.433 --> 01:26.873
…of passengers on the subways in Shanghai.

01:26.989 --> 01:31.305
Protesters have told us that police are checking if people have installed VPNs...

01:31.367 --> 01:33.880
…that can be used to circumvent China's firewall.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.655
Protesters need VPNs in order to use banned apps like Twitter...

01:37.728 --> 01:40.223
…and messaging apps like Telegram for communication.
