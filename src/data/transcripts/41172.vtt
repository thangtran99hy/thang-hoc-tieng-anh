Campaigners say Indonesia's new morality laws, given the green light by parliament,...

00:04.216 --> 00:08.516
...are a major setback to human rights in the world's most populous Muslim country.

00:08.825 --> 00:13.210
The most eye-catching measure, a clause that would outlaw sex before marriage.

00:13.281 --> 00:18.023
Now, under the law, sex outside of marriage will be punished with one year in prison,...

00:18.424 --> 00:20.432
...although it must be reported by a family member...

00:20.700 --> 00:23.251
...and the law will not come into effect for three years.

00:23.589 --> 00:27.393
Unmarried people living together could face six months in jail,...

00:27.866 --> 00:31.458
...but more broadly, spreading an ideology different to the official one,...

00:31.552 --> 00:33.550
...could get four years in prison.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.848
And there is a new clause against insulting the president as well.

00:38.597 --> 00:39.911
In all, it represents,...

00:40.005 --> 00:45.566
...a major shift in a country that's seeing growing Islamic influence in recent decades.

00:46.134 --> 00:48.755
Our correspondent in Jakarta is Valdya Baraputri.

00:49.027 --> 00:51.080
She's at Indonesia's parliament in Jakarta.

00:51.967 --> 00:57.333
For sex outside of marriage, the imprisonment is maximum up to one year,...

00:57.410 --> 01:01.680
...and for the cohabitation is up to six months.

01:01.761 --> 01:06.235
However, the only parties who can file the complaints...

01:06.326 --> 01:12.967
...are the spouses of these individuals who commit, now, crime or the parents.

01:13.145 --> 01:17.784
So, as you also mentioned that this new set of laws are applied...

01:17.886 --> 01:21.409
...not only to Indonesians, but also foreign visitors.

01:21.483 --> 01:26.583
So, for example, is if a foreign visitor engaged in sex outside of marriage...

01:26.753 --> 01:32.571
...with an Indonesian, then the spouse or the parents of the Indonesian...

01:32.654 --> 01:36.282
...can file a complaint if they chose to do so.

01:36.444 --> 01:41.648
As I said, the new set of law will take effect of maximum of three years,...

01:41.729 --> 01:45.607
...and during that time the public can take the articles...

01:45.686 --> 01:48.883
...they see as problematic to the Supreme Court.
