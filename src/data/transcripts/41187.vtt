Is there life on Mars?

00:08.156 --> 00:11.298
So we've been looking for life on Mars for a long time.

00:11.668 --> 00:15.104
And while NASA hasn't found any evidence of life now,...

00:15.316 --> 00:16.933
...we found lots of evidence...

00:17.013 --> 00:19.574
...that Mars could have supported life in the past.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.377
There's lots of pieces of evidence...

00:21.461 --> 00:23.861
...that say there was once a huge ocean on Mars...

00:24.146 --> 00:26.529
...and an atmosphere that could have supported life.

00:26.891 --> 00:29.584
But there's still a lot of Mars left to explore.

00:29.842 --> 00:33.777
There are places that are potentially habitable like the deep subsurface.

00:34.003 --> 00:36.917
There are places underground that could have fluids in them...

00:36.995 --> 00:40.343
...where organisms could live, and they'd be protected from the radiation...

00:40.449 --> 00:42.342
...that's so harmful on the surface.

00:42.609 --> 00:46.069
We're just now getting instruments onto the Martian surface...

00:46.223 --> 00:49.510
...that can help us understand these potentially habitable places.

00:49.713 --> 00:51.765
Then we can ask deeper questions...

00:51.885 --> 00:55.421
...about the potential for habitability in those rock cores.

00:55.615 --> 00:57.379
So is there life on Mars?

00:57.683 --> 01:01.848
Not that we've found yet, but there's still a lot of Mars left to explore.
