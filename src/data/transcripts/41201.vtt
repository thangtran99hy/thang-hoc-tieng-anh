00:00.050 --> 00:01.269
I wanna talk about something pretty big here.

00:01.330 --> 00:05.319
A potential breakthrough in tackling the most common form of dementia.

00:05.381 --> 00:07.325
It's a new drug being praised for its ability...

00:07.391 --> 00:09.715
...to slow the effects of Alzheimer's on the brain.

00:09.987 --> 00:11.094
Tell us more about this.

00:12.626 --> 00:14.583
Yeah, Joe and Savannah, this is breaking news...

00:14.704 --> 00:16.464
...published in the New England Journal of Medicine...

00:16.537 --> 00:19.215
...and it signals that we're getting ever closer,...

00:19.292 --> 00:22.067
...but probably not close enough for patient's comfort.

00:22.140 --> 00:26.731
This is a new medication that showed a significant decrease in dementia.

00:27.123 --> 00:31.397
It did have some side effects but it was something that had positive results...

00:31.493 --> 00:35.067
...in the trial to be significant enough, not just for Alzheimer's, dementia,...

00:35.149 --> 00:36.504
...possibly for other dementias.

00:36.943 --> 00:40.359
There is some important kind of development in anatomy...

00:40.431 --> 00:43.798
..that we see in patients with dementia in a plaque that can develop...

00:43.900 --> 00:48.067
...around the nervous system that shows that people might be more at risk...

00:48.167 --> 00:49.675
...or have significant dementia.

00:49.981 --> 00:52.781
And this particular drug was developed, Lecanemab,...

00:53.027 --> 00:58.273
...and it was partnership between the company Biogen and Eisai Pharmaceutical.

00:58.365 --> 01:03.333
So, this was a kind of a partnership of two very well-known CNS drug manufacturers.

01:03.678 --> 01:05.499
Here is the short kind of version, though.

01:05.851 --> 01:09.039
Savannah and Joe, we're not gonna necessarily see this result right away...

01:09.138 --> 01:12.876
...for dementia patients today, but hopefully we'll have signals for the future...

01:13.097 --> 01:14.426
...and some solutions in the end.

01:14.648 --> 01:16.893
We'll take all the promising news we can get on that.

01:17.014 --> 01:17.666
Yeah, we can.
