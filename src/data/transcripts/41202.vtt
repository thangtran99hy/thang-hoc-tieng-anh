When you're cold, or watching a scary movie,...

00:06.567 --> 00:09.741
...or maybe even when your favorite song plays at a concert,...

00:11.193 --> 00:13.833
...you might get little bumps all over your skin.

00:15.279 --> 00:18.828
That happens when tiny muscles on our body hair tighten up...

00:19.069 --> 00:20.915
...and make the hair stand upright.

00:21.943 --> 00:23.319
They're called goosebumps.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.748
So, why do we get them?

00:27.307 --> 00:30.452
It's an involuntary response to intense emotion.

00:30.828 --> 00:32.967
That's why you might get them when watching a horror movie.

00:33.567 --> 00:37.977
In fact, the word "horror" comes from a Latin word meaning, "to bristle with fear."

00:38.567 --> 00:41.512
Horripilation is the technical term for goosebumps.

00:42.829 --> 00:46.685
They got their name because, well, they look like the skin of a plucked bird.

00:49.673 --> 00:52.404
Goosebumps have a practical purpose for animals.

00:52.673 --> 00:54.083
When an animal's hair sticks up,...

00:54.163 --> 00:57.038
...it makes it look bigger and help protect it against predators.

00:57.442 --> 01:01.243
A raised layer of fur can also help keep an animal warm when it's cold.

01:02.453 --> 01:05.798
For humans, goosebumps don't act as any sort of survival reaction.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.666
Instead, experts say it's simply the result of a rush of adrenaline...

01:09.753 --> 01:11.631
...sparked by an extreme emotion.
