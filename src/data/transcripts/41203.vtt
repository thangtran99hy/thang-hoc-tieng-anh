If you're feeling sick, sad, or stressed, your dog might know before you.

00:05.105 --> 00:07.685
According to a new study published in PLOS One Journal,...

00:07.879 --> 00:11.621
...dogs can distinguish between when someone is stressed versus calm.

00:11.851 --> 00:13.849
Clara Wilson helped lead the research.

00:13.977 --> 00:17.895
We got people to do really hard math to stress them out

00:17.973 --> 00:19.783
We took samples from them before and after.

00:20.113 --> 00:24.015
And we trained dogs to be able to discriminate between these smells,...

00:24.123 --> 00:25.171
...and they were very able to do it.

00:25.257 --> 00:27.681
They could do it in around 94% of trials.

00:27.936 --> 00:30.803
That's because dogs have an incredible sense of smell.

00:31.171 --> 00:34.613
Canines have more than 200 million olfactory receptors.

00:35.003 --> 00:37.151
Those are the nerve endings inside your nose.

00:37.567 --> 00:39.565
Humans have about 50 million.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.788
But that nose structure isn't dogs' only advantage.

00:43.095 --> 00:48.693
They also have more of their brain region dedicated to processing smells than humans.

00:49.381 --> 00:55.699
So, they're able to detect one odorant in a much lower concentration than humans can.

00:56.429 --> 00:57.451
So, that really helps.

00:57.544 --> 00:59.542
And dogs can do more than sense stress.

00:59.743 --> 01:04.027
Other research points to their ability to know if you're happy or potentially sick.

01:04.417 --> 01:09.555
Dogs have detected diseases including breast cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer.

01:09.829 --> 01:10.997
And early in the pandemic,...

01:11.137 --> 01:14.565
...a Bay Area hospital has a new way to screen people for COVID-19...

01:14.644 --> 01:16.596
...with the help of a four-legged friend.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.985
Dogs trained to sniff out the coronavirus.

01:19.233 --> 01:22.088
That's because disease and illness change how our bodies smell.

01:22.267 --> 01:24.802
There is a lot of evidence that when we get sick,...

01:25.587 --> 01:28.486
...what's called our volatile organic compound profile,...

01:28.567 --> 01:31.709
...and that's all these compounds that are emitting through our breath and sweat,...

01:32.725 --> 01:33.758
...they change.

01:33.848 --> 01:35.131
And it's not just dogs.

01:35.233 --> 01:38.888
Researchers in Africa train rats to identify tuberculosis...

01:39.169 --> 01:43.293
...and other studies have found that fruit flies and pigeons can detect cancer cells.

01:43.421 --> 01:45.282
More research is needed to determine...

01:45.365 --> 01:48.309
...how effective these animals can be in detecting illness,...

01:48.621 --> 01:51.387
...but researchers say their ability to know how humans are feeling...

01:51.717 --> 01:55.849
...and sniff out potentially deadly diseases could lead to earlier detection.
