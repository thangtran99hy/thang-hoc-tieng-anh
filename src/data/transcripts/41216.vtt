00:07.394 --> 00:11.345
Brazilians idealized soccer, calling it "jogo bonito,"...

00:11.470 --> 00:12.552
..."the beautiful game."

00:13.194 --> 00:15.768
Pelé was its supreme artist.

00:16.582 --> 00:20.013
So brilliant were his skills, so vibrant his smile.

00:20.184 --> 00:24.656
He played at the 1958 World Cup and this global legend was born.

00:25.203 --> 00:29.029
The teenager scored five goals, two of them in the final,...

00:29.268 --> 00:32.014
...to lead Brazil to its first-ever world championship.

00:32.923 --> 00:36.121
He never did say goodbye to his game or his fans.

00:36.746 --> 00:40.276
Corporate endorsements carried him around the globe to promote soccer.

00:40.831 --> 00:44.371
Pelé continued to touch those too young to have ever seen him play,...

00:44.894 --> 00:47.536
...but knew the stories and images of the Brazilian...

00:47.735 --> 00:50.011
...who captured the world's heart as a teenager...

00:50.266 --> 00:54.261
...and spent a radiant lifetime starring in that affection.

00:55.132 --> 00:59.401
We used to say, when is there gonna to be a new Pelé?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.151
I say never.

01:01.463 --> 01:02.511
Could he be better?

01:02.612 --> 01:03.656
Could it be a different one?

01:03.777 --> 01:04.906
But no more.
