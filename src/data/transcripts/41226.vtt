00:05.599 --> 00:09.913
We're never going to stop exploring the unknown in air and space.

00:10.884 --> 00:14.964
We're not going to stop innovating for the benefit of humanity...

00:16.005 --> 00:18.795
...and inspiring the world through discovery.

00:22.927 --> 00:28.587
'22 will go down in the history books as one of the most accomplished years...

00:28.735 --> 00:33.597
...all of NASA's history and missions,...

00:33.960 --> 00:38.963
...the golden age of space exploration.

00:40.360 --> 00:44.156
There was a philosopher, a historian,...

00:45.407 --> 00:51.489
...someone who had a great grasp of the future named Carl Sagan, a scientist,...

00:52.794 --> 00:56.141
...and he said, "Exploration is in our nature.

00:57.213 --> 01:02.114
We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still.

01:03.564 --> 01:08.966
We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean.

01:09.285 --> 01:15.869
We are ready at last to set sail for the stars."

01:16.913 --> 01:19.733
We have set sail for the stars.

01:20.974 --> 01:26.034
Now we're going to reach out to the unreachable stars.
