MIT Dog Swim is our opportunity to open up a swim event...

00:14.564 --> 00:18.169
...for our four-legged friends in the MIT and extended community.

00:19.194 --> 00:22.287
I like the fact that we're doing something different...

00:22.375 --> 00:25.890
...other than the standard swimming leagues of the pool...

00:26.259 --> 00:27.607
...and running swim meets.

00:28.668 --> 00:30.107
Oh, it's super fun.

00:30.653 --> 00:33.996
I think it's really cool that they offer this, especially in the winter.

00:34.657 --> 00:36.439
I'm a little jealous I don't get to go in,...

00:36.757 --> 00:40.480
...but I think it's a really, really neat opportunity for the dogs.

00:41.539 --> 00:45.217
I can't lie; this is the best day at any job I've ever had.
