00:00.050 --> 00:03.101
China now, it has denounced the decision to impose restrictions...

00:03.167 --> 00:06.446
…on Chinese travelers because of the rising COVID infections...

00:06.643 --> 00:08.881
…and warned it might take reciprocal action.

00:09.419 --> 00:12.024
International health officials have criticized Beijing...

00:12.117 --> 00:14.914
…for failing to release data on the spread of the virus...

00:14.987 --> 00:16.637
…and possible new variants.

00:17.086 --> 00:21.297
The U.S. and about a dozen other countries will require those arriving from China...

00:21.500 --> 00:23.939
...to produce negative test certificates.

00:24.536 --> 00:27.798
Many Chinese have been rushing to book their first overseas trips in years,...

00:27.871 --> 00:30.622
…after Beijing lifted its own travel restrictions.

00:31.176 --> 00:35.599
Well, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson condemned the requirements on travelers.

00:39.233 --> 00:42.671
We are willing to strengthen communication with the international community...

00:42.742 --> 00:45.491
…and work hard together to overcome the epidemic.

00:45.863 --> 00:50.252
At the same time, we also believe that some countries have imposed entry restrictions...

00:50.507 --> 00:52.473
…targeting only Chinese travelers.

00:52.783 --> 00:56.693
This lacks scientific basis and some practices are unacceptable.

00:57.071 --> 01:01.128
We firmly oppose any attempts to manipulate epidemic prevention measures...

01:01.404 --> 01:03.334
...in order to achieve political goals.

01:03.601 --> 01:07.373
We will take countermeasures based on the principle of reciprocity.
