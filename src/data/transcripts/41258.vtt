00:00.050 --> 00:03.041
Now to South Asia, and the Taliban government of Afghanistan...

00:03.137 --> 00:06.761
…has ordered an indefinite ban on university education for women.

00:07.216 --> 00:10.185
The order was signed by the Minister of Higher Education,...

00:10.283 --> 00:13.731
…further restricting women's access to formal schooling.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.273
Just three months after thousands of girls and women...

00:16.359 --> 00:18.881
...sat university entrance exams across the country.

00:19.382 --> 00:20.985
Azade Mashiri has this report.

00:23.638 --> 00:28.767
The Taliban takeover meant only one thing for the women and girls of Afghanistan:...

00:29.331 --> 00:29.866
...fear.

00:30.850 --> 00:35.042
Fear they'd lose their freedoms, their education, their future.

00:36.567 --> 00:41.086
More than a year later, the direction of travel has been cemented.

00:41.445 --> 00:44.445
Women no longer have access to university.

00:44.952 --> 00:48.395
Women of Afghanistan have been doomed from the very first day...

00:48.474 --> 00:50.359
...that this group took over.

00:50.661 --> 00:58.365
Like the flagship of conduct is oppression of women.

00:58.779 --> 01:00.773
The war in Afghanistan has not ended.

01:00.870 --> 01:02.063
There is no peace.

01:02.873 --> 01:05.341
There has been a steady stream of setbacks.

01:05.629 --> 01:06.676
Here are just a few.

01:07.301 --> 01:11.857
In March, the Taliban broke their promise to reopen secondary school for girls.

01:12.601 --> 01:16.886
Two months later, women were forced to veil their faces, as well as their hair.

01:17.699 --> 01:21.121
In September, the Women's Affairs Ministry was disbanded...

01:21.598 --> 01:22.770
...and only last month,...

01:23.134 --> 01:27.059
...women were barred from parks, gyms, and swimming pools in the capital.

01:27.667 --> 01:31.825
It's another very troubling, troubling move...

01:32.607 --> 01:37.296
...and it's difficult to imagine how a country can develop,...

01:38.638 --> 01:41.832
...can deal with all of its, the challenges that it has...

01:42.390 --> 01:47.183
...without the active participation of women and the education of women.
