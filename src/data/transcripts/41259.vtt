Inflation has impacted many areas of our lives such as gas, home, and grocery prices,...

00:05.405 --> 00:09.013
...but it has also impacted the cost of dating.

00:09.386 --> 00:13.076
Infla-dating is a new trend where couples go on less expensive dates...

00:13.167 --> 00:16.217
...due to the rise in prices and everyday expenses.

00:16.508 --> 00:19.111
From walks in the park to cheaper dinner ideas,..

00:19.367 --> 00:23.280
...the cost of dating is now having to take a creative turn.

00:23.487 --> 00:28.071
But luckily, we have Ted Jenkin here with us today to talk about infla-dating...

00:28.149 --> 00:30.669
...and what this means for the dating scene right now.

00:30.743 --> 00:33.281
And Ted, tell us what is infla-dating,...

00:33.367 --> 00:37.953
...and are people actually overextending themselves financially on the dating scene?

00:39.467 --> 00:40.702
Yeah, well, good to see you Holly.

00:40.781 --> 00:43.269
Look, in this term infla-dating, which you're gonna hear more of,...

00:43.367 --> 00:47.717
...it's really just a way to describe going on lower cost dates as you talked about,...

00:47.791 --> 00:51.813
...while we still have rising and spiking prices in food and drink...

00:51.882 --> 00:53.050
...and just going out overall.

00:53.121 --> 00:56.495
We saw last week that inflation was still north of 7%.

00:56.567 --> 00:58.433
But a lot of people that are in the dating scene realized...

00:58.525 --> 01:01.775
...that dining out and entertainment is still at double digit growth.

01:02.261 --> 01:06.533
What's interesting is that 22% of all millennials right now say,...

01:06.865 --> 01:08.250
"...Dating is making me broke."

01:08.335 --> 01:11.766
And 85% of all millennials right now are saying,...

01:11.843 --> 01:14.057
"...You know what, it's okay to go on a lower cost date."

01:14.399 --> 01:18.326
It's costing the average person more than $100 a night to go out...

01:18.577 --> 01:22.539
...and it's costing the average dater more than $3000 across America...

01:22.771 --> 01:24.469
...over the course of a year in their budget,...

01:24.549 --> 01:27.075
...and in urban areas that can be double or triple.

01:27.150 --> 01:30.828
So, it's expensive right now for dating with inflation being high.
