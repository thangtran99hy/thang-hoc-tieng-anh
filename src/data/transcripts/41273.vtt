00:01.659 --> 00:02.249
All right, welcome back.

00:02.324 --> 00:05.999
Twitter users voting for Elon Musk to step down as head of Twitter...

00:06.071 --> 00:09.683
…less than two months after he took over the social media platform.

00:09.753 --> 00:10.850
Yeah, this all happened last night.

00:10.943 --> 00:14.387
Musk created a poll asking users if he should step down...

00:14.457 --> 00:16.801
…saying he will abide by the results.

00:17.165 --> 00:18.570
The poll closed this morning...

00:18.639 --> 00:22.635
…and about fifty-seven percent of respondents said he should go.

00:22.963 --> 00:25.176
More than seventeen million people have voted.

00:25.405 --> 00:28.301
The poll followed another tweet where Musk said, quote,...

00:28.538 --> 00:32.186
…"Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes."

00:32.335 --> 00:34.650
"My apologies. Won't happen again."

00:34.929 --> 00:37.875
Now, Musk's October takeover of the social media platform...

00:38.316 --> 00:41.153
…has been marred in controversy amid the Tesla founder's mission...

00:41.233 --> 00:45.587
...to make the platform a mainstay for free speech, but the restrictions keep coming.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.587
On Sunday, the bird app announced it will ban accounts...

00:48.657 --> 00:50.683
…that promote other social media sites.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.496
We're talking Instagram, Facebook, Mastodon.

00:53.742 --> 00:57.248
In a now deleted tweet, the tech company support account said,...

00:57.567 --> 01:00.675
...it acknowledges that users are active on other social media sites,...

01:00.757 --> 01:03.604
…but it will remove accounts specifically created...

01:03.675 --> 01:07.738
...to promote sites or contain links and usernames pushing to other platforms.

01:07.815 --> 01:13.093
However, social media sites like Tiktok and WhatsApp were not included in the ban.

01:13.324 --> 01:17.937
Now, this is all happening as Elon Musk pushes for users to pay for the platform,...

01:18.298 --> 01:20.659
…which has caused a lot of backlash to say the least.
