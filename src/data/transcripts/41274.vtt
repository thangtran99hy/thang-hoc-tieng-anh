00:00.050 --> 00:03.560
Starbucks workers at stores across the U.S. have walked off the job...

00:03.630 --> 00:07.161
...in a dispute over unionization efforts at the coffee giant.

00:07.567 --> 00:10.329
The walkout comes after a one-day strike last month...

00:10.407 --> 00:12.731
…on the retailer's popular Red Cup Day...

00:13.088 --> 00:15.431
…when it gives away reusable holiday cups.

00:15.873 --> 00:19.659
The Starbucks Worker United Union reported it has won votes...

00:19.735 --> 00:22.604
...at almost three hundred stores so far.

00:23.332 --> 00:27.182
The union is protesting what it calls unfair labor practices.

00:27.443 --> 00:31.113
Newsy national correspondent, James Packard, is live tonight from Los Angeles...

00:31.189 --> 00:34.069
...and James bring us up to date on what exactly is happening...

00:34.152 --> 00:36.757
…and really how big an impact the strike could have.

00:37.934 --> 00:40.741
Yeah, hey Julie, well, we're only talking about one hundred stores here,...

00:40.824 --> 00:44.398
...but, in some cases, the stores simply can't afford to stay open...

00:44.473 --> 00:47.795
…without the number of workers who have walked off the job today.

00:47.870 --> 00:50.616
So, that means, in some select Starbucks locations,...

00:50.694 --> 00:51.969
…stores are closed today,...

00:52.057 --> 00:56.517
…people being turned away at the door as workers walk off the job.

00:56.601 --> 01:00.233
But Starbucks says, in a majority of its thousands of locations,...

01:00.715 --> 01:03.393
…the operations continue almost as usual.

01:03.486 --> 01:07.680
In some cases, it's managers who are managing to keep things going today...

01:07.761 --> 01:08.744
...without a number of workers.

01:08.812 --> 01:10.703
In other cases, there are no walk offs.

01:10.962 --> 01:14.183
Again, we're only talking about roughly one hundred stores here,...

01:14.279 --> 01:16.829
…but these workers are part of a fresh effort,...

01:17.124 --> 01:18.964
…really only about a year old at Starbucks,...

01:19.040 --> 01:21.351
...to improve working conditions.

01:21.653 --> 01:25.337
Among their demands, they want, obviously, the right to organize.

01:25.741 --> 01:30.191
They want guaranteed shifts for part-time and full-time workers, respectively.

01:30.512 --> 01:33.075
Being able to predict how many hours a week you're going to work...

01:33.191 --> 01:36.432
…based on whether you're a part-time or full-time employee,...

01:36.859 --> 01:41.972
…better health and safety at work and on the job seniority as well.

01:42.422 --> 01:44.541
As I said, this is a really fresh movement,...

01:44.647 --> 01:49.429
…but it is part of a broader national shift in favor of labor unions.
