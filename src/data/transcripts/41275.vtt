00:00.050 --> 00:02.802
Croatia has become the 20th country to join the Eurozone...

00:03.290 --> 00:05.277
...as it adopted the Euro as its currency.

00:05.778 --> 00:07.556
BBC's Emily Brown explains why.

00:09.965 --> 00:12.055
A new year, a new currency.

00:12.624 --> 00:17.002
Croatia says goodbye to its Kuna currency as it adopts the Euro.

00:18.815 --> 00:21.337
This is the moment the country's Finance Minister...

00:21.437 --> 00:24.030
…pulls out the first Euro bill from a cash machine.

00:24.740 --> 00:28.093
And Croatia will become the 20th member of the Eurozone...

00:28.379 --> 00:31.109
…after nearly a decade since it joined the EU.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.411
The nation of four million people joins the Schengen Zone...

00:35.567 --> 00:38.767
…which allows people to move freely around its member nations.

00:39.233 --> 00:42.018
But Croatians have mixed feelings about the change.

00:42.595 --> 00:45.357
It's always great for me to have Kuna when I came to Croatia,...

00:45.446 --> 00:46.542
…but the Euro is easier.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.215
It's easier when you're in Europe.

00:49.567 --> 00:53.067
We can be emotionally attached to the Kuna because of history...

00:53.364 --> 00:55.105
…but one has to live realistically.

00:55.497 --> 00:58.339
It's always better to be with someone who is strong,...

00:58.723 --> 01:01.384
…who is something, than to be on the sidelines.

01:02.695 --> 01:06.807
I love Kuna and as you can hear, we will have as much as our pension allows.

01:09.015 --> 01:13.246
Meanwhile, experts say adopting the Euro will help protect Croatia's economy...

01:13.607 --> 01:16.415
...at a time when inflation has been soaring globally,...

01:16.685 --> 01:18.674
…since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

01:19.772 --> 01:22.807
And it's hoped its entry into a borderless area...

01:23.112 --> 01:25.410
…will provide a boost to the tourism industry.

01:25.999 --> 01:31.781
It's an important milestone in the history of Croatia, the Euro, and the EU as a whole.

01:32.213 --> 01:34.113
