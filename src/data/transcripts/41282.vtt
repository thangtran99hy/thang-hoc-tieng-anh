00:00.103 --> 00:02.153
One of the biggest mistakes people generally make,...

00:02.230 --> 00:04.416
...and I'm guilty of it, too, is wishful thinking.

00:04.861 --> 00:08.497
You know, you want something to be true even if it isn't true.

00:09.961 --> 00:13.271
And so you ignore the things that, you ignore the real truth...

00:13.517 --> 00:14.927
...because of what you want to be true.

00:15.332 --> 00:17.635
This is a very difficult trap to avoid.

00:17.927 --> 00:23.377
And like I said, it's certainly one that I find myself in, having problems with.

00:23.872 --> 00:28.093
But if you just take that approach of, you're always to some degree wrong,...

00:28.335 --> 00:30.042
...and your goal is to be less wrong.
