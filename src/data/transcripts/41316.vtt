00:00.400 --> 00:04.086
Now, to an international report which says that human action...

00:04.159 --> 00:06.655
...to save the ozone layer appears to have worked.

00:07.010 --> 00:09.861
The study says it should fully recover within decades...

00:10.161 --> 00:12.826
...as Naomi Choi Smith now reports.

00:13.424 --> 00:16.730
The ozone layer, a thin shield that protects us...

00:16.820 --> 00:19.148
...from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays,...

00:19.459 --> 00:22.891
...damaged and depleted by chemicals released into the atmosphere.

00:23.453 --> 00:25.578
Now, finally some good news.

00:26.061 --> 00:31.030
The ozone layer is healing and could be fully restored in the next four decades.

00:31.766 --> 00:35.937
That's according to a new report co-authored by the UN, U.S., and EU...

00:36.453 --> 00:40.894
...which says, human action to ban ozone harming chemicals is working.

00:41.271 --> 00:45.922
The phase out of nearly 99% of banned ozone depleting substances...

00:46.407 --> 00:48.768
...has succeeded in safeguarding the ozone layer,...

00:48.847 --> 00:53.160
...leading to notable recovery of the ozone layer in the upper stratosphere...

00:53.233 --> 00:57.661
...and decreased human exposure to harmful ultraviolet rays from the Sun.

00:58.373 --> 01:01.631
Holes were first discovered in the ozone layer in the 1980s.

01:01.934 --> 01:06.619
By 1987, 46 countries had signed up to the Montreal Protocol,...

01:07.084 --> 01:10.621
...banning gases in aerosols and fridges called CFCs.

01:11.003 --> 01:15.139
They were destroying the ozone letting through harmful ultraviolet rays...

01:15.211 --> 01:17.451
...that can cause problems like skin cancer.

01:18.116 --> 01:21.947
But while the depletion of ozone is not a major cause of climate change,...

01:22.297 --> 01:26.581
...saving the ozone layer does have a positive knock-on effect on global warming,...

01:27.089 --> 01:31.573
...because some of the chemicals that were phased out are powerful greenhouse gases.

01:32.128 --> 01:35.959
The report says the ozone layer should recover to 1980 levels...

01:36.064 --> 01:41.420
...by roughly 2066 over the Antarctic, by 2045 over the Arctic,...

01:41.777 --> 01:44.409
...and by 2040 for the rest of the world.

01:45.069 --> 01:47.923
There's always the risk that progress could be reversed.

01:48.453 --> 01:52.223
Still the UN is optimistic, saying this sets a good example...

01:52.305 --> 01:57.854
...for other environmental action as the battle for our planet's future isn't over yet.
