A treasure hunt is underway in the Netherlands...

00:02.300 --> 00:06.323
...to find valuables worth millions hidden by Nazi soldiers during World War II.

00:06.395 --> 00:10.939
It's been sparked by the publication of an old map by the Dutch National Archive.

00:11.289 --> 00:14.485
It's believed the document marks the spot where German soldiers...

00:14.908 --> 00:18.971
...hid diamonds, rubies, gold, and silver taken from a damaged bank.

00:19.100 --> 00:22.148
Our correspondent, Anna Holligan, says treasure hunters have descended...

00:22.221 --> 00:25.155
...on a small town looking for metal ammunition boxes.

00:26.631 --> 00:29.096
Well, nothing quite sparks the imagination, does it?

00:29.179 --> 00:31.947
A real life treasure map.

00:32.047 --> 00:34.748
This is what has been released by The National Archives...

00:35.088 --> 00:40.959
...and it's alleged to show the exact spot where a Nazi soldier buried loot...

00:41.080 --> 00:44.954
...taken during the Second World War during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.

00:45.341 --> 00:49.983
Four ammunition boxes apparently full of polished and uncut diamonds,...

00:50.071 --> 00:52.285
...gold, silver watches, and jewelry.

00:53.519 --> 00:57.492
The map has just been released and treasure hunters, gold diggers,...

00:57.563 --> 01:00.405
...from right across the Netherlands have descended on this small village.

01:00.481 --> 01:05.343
So initially, villagers were quite excited, enamored to see...

01:05.423 --> 01:10.817
...their village featured, not so much now that people have been appearing...

01:10.909 --> 01:15.717
...armed with metal detectors and spades digging up their gardens.

01:15.794 --> 01:19.627
Metal detectors are actually banned in the area as of October,...

01:20.219 --> 01:23.151
...so people have been turned away by the council.

01:23.257 --> 01:29.661
A few fines have been issued as well, but given the potential discovery here,...

01:30.033 --> 01:34.985
...it's unlikely to stop these treasure hunters from trying their luck.

01:35.233 --> 01:38.703
And if they do find anything, it was actually highly unlikely...

01:38.795 --> 01:43.120
...because the area was scoured just after the Second World War...

01:43.191 --> 01:45.234
...after this was initially revealed.

01:45.323 --> 01:47.104
The map has been released this week...

01:47.183 --> 01:52.036
...after the time with which it could be kept secret or undercover.

01:52.967 --> 01:55.670
Expires at 75 years, I think it is.

01:55.729 --> 01:59.953
So, it's free and available for anyone to go and have a search.

02:00.033 --> 02:02.917
Although the councilors are urging people to stay away.
