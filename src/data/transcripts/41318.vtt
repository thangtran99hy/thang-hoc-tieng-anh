00:00.313 --> 00:04.145
For the first time in more than 60 years, China's population has fallen.

00:04.319 --> 00:07.350
This could indicate the possible start of a long-term decline.

00:07.852 --> 00:09.935
Beijing's National Bureau of Statistics said...

00:10.011 --> 00:14.882
…the population decreased by 850,000 people to 1.4 billion.

00:15.249 --> 00:19.391
The country also reported its lowest birth rate since official records began...

00:19.707 --> 00:21.864
…and its highest death rate in decades.

00:22.351 --> 00:25.476
China's one child policy ended in 2015...

00:25.598 --> 00:28.277
…but despite various incentives offered by the government...

00:28.342 --> 00:30.455
…the growth rate has continued to fall.

00:30.820 --> 00:33.624
Our reporter, Katie Silva, is following developments in Singapore.

00:33.705 --> 00:34.741
Hi, Katie, good to see you.

00:34.819 --> 00:36.671
I mean, these are really significant figures, aren't they?

00:38.264 --> 00:38.617
They are.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.065
So, you wouldn't think a country with a population of 1.4 billion...

00:42.144 --> 00:44.989
…would be concerned about having a few less,...

00:45.069 --> 00:50.637
…but as you mentioned, 850,000 fewer from the end of 2021 to the end of 2022...

00:50.700 --> 00:51.846
…if we look backwards one year.

00:51.925 --> 00:53.571
And the reason that they are concerned by this...

00:53.645 --> 00:56.303
...is many say this is a population time bomb...

00:56.374 --> 00:58.915
…that it is ushering in a period of decline.

00:58.981 --> 01:04.343
And this is likely to be a trend and these numbers dropping are likely to continue.

01:04.414 --> 01:08.331
Now, as you mentioned the death and birth rate were also the lowest in years,...

01:08.629 --> 01:12.413
…and many are saying as well that with China giving up its zero COVID policy,...

01:12.491 --> 01:17.020
…the increase in spike in cases and the problems when it comes to hospitalizations,...

01:17.518 --> 01:20.655
…that's going to do nothing to try and help alleviate this burden...

01:20.724 --> 01:22.371
…when it comes to the death rate.

01:22.678 --> 01:24.850
Now, many hospitals there as I mentioned, overwhelmed.

01:24.929 --> 01:28.200
We've been hearing as well from the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics.

01:28.611 --> 01:32.342
He's given something more of an outline about exactly what the numbers are telling us.
