00:00.061 --> 00:01.418
What is your coolest scar?

00:02.045 --> 00:03.818
My coolest scar?

00:05.477 --> 00:06.811
That's actually a really good question.

00:08.999 --> 00:10.093
Oh my goodness.

00:10.672 --> 00:16.356
I just have to do that randomly and just, I'm okay, okay, wait.

00:16.727 --> 00:19.181
Does the scar have to do with a broken neck?

00:19.943 --> 00:24.129
I have a scar on the back of my calf.

00:25.491 --> 00:26.163
OK.

00:27.714 --> 00:30.228
I don't know if it's cool, but it's large.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.147
It's very large.

00:31.245 --> 00:31.981
How did it happen?

00:33.408 --> 00:35.551
I was in...

00:36.136 --> 00:37.320
I'm sensing a lie here.

00:37.981 --> 00:38.896
Temecula.

00:42.551 --> 00:43.382
I was in Temecula...

00:44.137 --> 00:47.663
I was in Temecula doing a horse show.

00:48.528 --> 00:50.094
Were you riding the horse?

00:50.187 --> 00:50.531
Yes.

00:50.673 --> 00:52.805
Like a dressage or something?

00:53.048 --> 00:53.633
Yeah, eventing.

00:53.857 --> 00:54.519
Eventing.

00:54.608 --> 00:54.914
Yeah.

00:55.094 --> 01:00.559
And I was at the house for the weekend up there, an Airbnb,...

01:01.248 --> 01:03.493
...and I was taking a shower after a long day,...

01:04.252 --> 01:14.216
...and I tried to sit down in the shower and the back of my calf touched...

01:14.773 --> 01:20.214
...like a little thing that was producing steam in the shower...

01:22.161 --> 01:23.377
...and I got a second degree burn.
