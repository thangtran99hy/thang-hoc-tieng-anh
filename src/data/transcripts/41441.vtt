00:01.036 --> 00:01.757
Sugar.

00:03.186 --> 00:04.415
It's everywhere.

00:04.809 --> 00:10.025
It's addictive and deadly, but it has also become an integral part of living in Indonesia.

00:10.894 --> 00:14.697
It's a common sight to see people adding sugar to food and beverages...

00:14.773 --> 00:16.023
…that are naturally sweet.

00:17.373 --> 00:20.851
Like many here, Noviandrini used to have a sweet tooth.

00:21.648 --> 00:25.043
But that changed recently, after the 50 year old found out...

00:25.115 --> 00:27.363
…that she was on the verge of getting diabetes.

00:30.481 --> 00:33.933
It's quite difficult to find sugar-free food for diabetics here.

00:33.986 --> 00:35.649
But my daughter has found a place.

00:35.889 --> 00:38.179
She knows where to buy sugar-free cakes.

00:38.729 --> 00:42.622
But in general, it's very difficult for us, especially for diabetics.

00:45.701 --> 00:49.110
In Indonesia, the number of overweight and obese young people...

00:49.187 --> 00:51.508
…has more than doubled in the last ten years,...

00:52.211 --> 00:55.299
…caused mostly by excessive consumption of sugar.

00:55.939 --> 01:00.445
The government's plan to impose an excise tax on sugary products is meeting some resistance.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.956
If sugary products become more expensive,...

01:03.280 --> 01:04.574
…fewer people will buy them.

01:04.884 --> 01:06.313
Good news for the nation's health.

01:06.595 --> 01:09.858
But some fear it could also impact the nation's economic recovery.

01:11.043 --> 01:16.026
Olivia Herlinda works for the center for Indonesia's Strategic Development Initiative,...

01:16.232 --> 01:19.202
...an NGO specializing in public health policy.

01:19.757 --> 01:23.951
She warns the government will have to be careful how it applies the tax...

01:24.091 --> 01:25.316
…when it passes the law.

01:28.484 --> 01:31.497
Sugar excise tax needs to be evenly enforced...

01:31.675 --> 01:36.509
…because countries that did it partly ended up having people looking for cheaper products,...

01:36.681 --> 01:40.106
…while not changing the overall sugar consumption levels much.

01:42.473 --> 01:44.220
Apart from the excise tax,...

01:44.421 --> 01:49.175
…the health authorities have also been trying to generate public awareness about diabetes,...

01:49.421 --> 01:52.168
...as well as implement an early detection program.

01:53.161 --> 01:56.025
Early detection certainly helped Noviandrini.

01:56.548 --> 01:59.760
She hopes to avoid the disease by transforming her lifestyle.

02:00.328 --> 02:05.299
She'll do it not only for herself, but to live longer for her loved ones.
