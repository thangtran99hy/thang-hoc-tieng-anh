Is there weather on the Moon?

00:09.771 --> 00:14.211
Well, because the Moon doesn't have a significant atmosphere like Earth,...

00:14.375 --> 00:19.007
...it does not experience weather like wind or atmospheric temperature...

00:19.206 --> 00:21.220
...or precipitation like rain and snow.

00:21.634 --> 00:26.291
However, the Moon does experience what we refer to as space weather.

00:26.771 --> 00:32.488
Space weather loosely refers to how changing conditions throughout the solar system,...

00:32.601 --> 00:33.973
...like the burning solar wind,...

00:34.085 --> 00:38.511
...which is composed of charged particles from the sun and meteoroid streams,...

00:38.619 --> 00:42.264
...affect planetary surfaces and volatile cycles.

00:42.533 --> 00:47.964
So at the Moon, the solar wind and meteoroids have direct access to the surface,...

00:48.185 --> 00:51.191
...and they continuously alter the lunar soil.

00:51.373 --> 00:55.319
These same processes can eject gases from the lunar soil...

00:55.457 --> 00:58.519
...and form a very tenuous lunar atmosphere,....

00:58.619 --> 01:00.403
...which we refer to as an exosphere.

01:00.641 --> 01:05.743
At Earth, our atmosphere and magnetosphere largely protects us from space weather.

01:05.984 --> 01:08.924
However, in the uppermost regions of Earth's atmosphere,...

01:09.049 --> 01:12.005
...it can be a problem for satellite technologies.

01:12.327 --> 01:14.845
So is there weather on the Moon?

01:15.144 --> 01:18.975
The Moon does not experience weather like on Earth related to the atmosphere.

01:19.087 --> 01:21.387
However, it does experience space weather,...

01:21.475 --> 01:25.322
...and that will be very important to forecast as humans return to the Moon.
