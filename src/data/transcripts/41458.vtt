00:00.743 --> 00:03.161
The Eurozone has dodged a recession.

00:03.383 --> 00:04.355
Figures out Tuesday...

00:04.469 --> 00:07.833
...showed surprise growth over the final three months of last year.

00:08.181 --> 00:12.579
The bloc's economy eked out expansion of 0.1 percent over the fourth quarter.

00:12.972 --> 00:17.061
Not much, but better than the drop that economists had expected.

00:17.650 --> 00:22.326
Among big countries, Germany and Italy saw economic activity contract,...

00:22.758 --> 00:25.569
...but France and Spain posted expansion.

00:26.164 --> 00:29.083
The gains come despite an energy price crunch.

00:29.432 --> 00:32.635
Soaring costs for fuel have depleted household savings...

00:32.795 --> 00:34.279
...and held back investment.

00:34.826 --> 00:38.711
They've also forced the European Central Bank into unprecedented rate hikes...

00:38.840 --> 00:40.184
...to cool inflation.

00:40.557 --> 00:44.674
But the region's economy has shown unexpected resilience too.

00:45.134 --> 00:49.080
This week, that prompted the IMF to raise its forecasts for growth.

00:49.621 --> 00:54.188
It now expects the Eurozone economy to expand 0.7 percent this year.

00:54.691 --> 00:58.316
That's up from an earlier prediction of 0.5 percent.

00:58.813 --> 01:03.832
Even so, growth in 2023 is expected to be among the weakest on record,...

01:04.002 --> 01:07.348
...thanks to falling real incomes and those surging rates.

01:07.913 --> 01:12.760
The ECB has already lifted rates by a total of 2.5 percentage points,...

01:13.157 --> 01:16.623
...and markets bet there is significantly more to come.
