00:00.132 --> 00:01.990
Can we say Einstein was a lot smarter than Newton?

00:02.089 --> 00:03.869
No, actually, if you want to put them head-to-head,...

00:03.959 --> 00:05.074
...I think I'd put Newton ahead.

00:05.199 --> 00:05.407
What?

00:05.635 --> 00:07.824
Yeah, because Newton came into the world...

00:07.921 --> 00:10.311
...and there wasn't a base of scientific understanding...

00:10.395 --> 00:11.625
...from him to jump off from.

00:11.787 --> 00:13.631
He had no shoulders of giants to stand on.

00:13.721 --> 00:15.110
Although he said that he did.

00:15.299 --> 00:17.730
But that was just, you know, being quite gracious.

00:17.847 --> 00:20.875
He really invented modern way of looking at the world,...

00:20.984 --> 00:23.785
...the mathematical insights to the nature of reality.
