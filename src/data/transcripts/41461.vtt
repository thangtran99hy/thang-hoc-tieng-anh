We're so used to seeing these in takeaway shops.

00:02.965 --> 00:07.488
Polystyrene containers have become key to grabbing food or drinks on the go.

00:07.777 --> 00:11.072
Useful and cheap, but an environmental hazard.

00:11.357 --> 00:15.715
So, many single-use plastics will be banned in England from October.

00:16.057 --> 00:19.183
Businesses will have to find biodegradable alternatives...

00:19.398 --> 00:21.731
…like wooden cutlery or paper cups.

00:22.037 --> 00:26.819
The manager at this cafe in East London is worried about the cost at a time...

00:26.915 --> 00:28.568
…when they're already struggling.

00:29.075 --> 00:31.309
Absolutely every piece of stock, everything you see,...

00:31.419 --> 00:35.533
…every item of food has risen in price within the last one year.

00:35.615 --> 00:41.042
So, you know, this little thing it may seem like something small, but it's not.

00:42.306 --> 00:46.227
The government says the public is overwhelmingly in favor of the ban...

00:46.501 --> 00:51.291
…but, it's a big shift for the hospitality sector in particular coming up in Autumn.

00:51.656 --> 00:53.957
We've worked very very closely with business and industry,...

00:54.027 --> 00:56.434
…because we obviously realize there's an impact on them...

00:56.659 --> 00:59.996
…and this gives them time to get, to use up stock that they've already got...

01:00.075 --> 01:01.952
…because they didn't want to just have to ditch it.

01:02.179 --> 01:03.810
That doesn't really make sense either.

01:04.153 --> 01:07.125
The change follows similar moves in Scotland and Wales.

01:07.438 --> 01:11.489
Packaging like this used for Supermarket meals will not be banned,...

01:11.820 --> 01:15.926
…but conservation charities want the government to go further faster.

01:16.233 --> 01:20.806
We really need to see that the plastic pollution tap turned off.

01:21.132 --> 01:24.145
What we're seeing at the moment now is essentially policies...

01:24.233 --> 01:26.041
…that are bailing out the bath water...

01:26.456 --> 01:32.699
…and we need to see those policies implemented in a strategic coordinated approach...

01:32.881 --> 01:35.583
…across all of the nations within the UK.

01:35.869 --> 01:38.378
The cost to the environment currently is clear.

01:38.697 --> 01:42.592
Plastic washing up on beaches or poisoning marine wildlife.

01:43.001 --> 01:45.202
But now businesses and perhaps customers...

01:45.387 --> 01:48.850
…will face the cost of making our waste less toxic.

01:49.074 --> 01:50.829
