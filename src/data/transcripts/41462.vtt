00:01.674 --> 00:04.465
Nothing could be more analog than parcels and letters,...

00:04.939 --> 00:08.396
...but this week their movement was halted by a very modern disruption.

00:09.095 --> 00:12.078
Royal Mail sorting offices were struck by a cyber attack...

00:12.276 --> 00:15.271
...which left it unable to dispatch letters and parcels overseas.

00:15.862 --> 00:18.205
It all happened like a scene in a film.

00:18.909 --> 00:22.223
According to reports, the printers in the Royal Mail sorting office...

00:22.433 --> 00:26.293
...suddenly started spewing out messages from the Lockbit Ransomware Gang,...

00:26.544 --> 00:31.422
...saying your data are stolen and encrypted and demanding payment...

00:31.577 --> 00:32.633
...to sort the situation out.

00:33.900 --> 00:37.588
Dramatic, simple, and horribly effective.

00:37.863 --> 00:41.558
And it all leave the victim wondering, "What on Earth do I do now?"

00:42.660 --> 00:44.117
It's the question Kieran Martin,...

00:44.235 --> 00:47.520
...formerly head of the National Cybersecurity Center, now an Oxford Don,...

00:47.802 --> 00:49.007
...has been asked many times.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.595
So, should you pay?

00:52.167 --> 00:57.661
The government advises no, I would advise no, but plenty of people do.

00:59.211 --> 01:01.583
What I would encourage people to think about,...

01:01.651 --> 01:04.287
...as well as the ethics and morality of paying...

01:05.435 --> 01:08.520
...is sometimes, practically, it doesn't make sense to pay.

01:09.048 --> 01:13.166
Ransomware gangs like Lockbit use a virus to scramble the files on your computers...

01:13.320 --> 01:15.928
...and send you a message demanding a ransom for unscrambling them.

01:16.603 --> 01:21.198
Lockbit victims number well over 1000 including the automotive group Continental,...

01:21.633 --> 01:25.288
...British company Kingfisher Insurance, rail operator Merseyrail,...

01:25.692 --> 01:27.411
...and consultancy firm Accenture.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.185
Like many ransomware gangs, Lockbit has ties to Russia,...

01:31.525 --> 01:35.026
...although experts play down the possibility of a nation-state attack.

01:35.741 --> 01:39.009
More likely, it's just the latest example of a criminal boom.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.715
The Guardian was hit by a ransomware attack this month,...

01:42.167 --> 01:43.898
...just one of thousands every year.

01:44.637 --> 01:48.650
That doesn't cut it with frustrated Royal Mail customers like Andrew Pope.

01:49.257 --> 01:51.436
This is the last nail in the coffin for me.

01:51.786 --> 01:53.735
I've already transferred my UK business,...

01:53.808 --> 01:55.337
...away from Royal Mail, to the other providers.

01:55.403 --> 01:57.021
I didn't want to, but I had to.

01:57.565 --> 01:59.299
And now the international business that I have,...

01:59.367 --> 02:02.378
...which is about a fifth of the business, I'll also transfer away from Royal Mail.

02:02.973 --> 02:04.824
Royal Mail declined to comment on the incident,...

02:05.332 --> 02:06.650
...but it still hasn't resolved the problem,...

02:06.833 --> 02:09.655
...and the backlog of parcels is already over half a million.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.832
Closing the door on this incident, it takes some doing.

02:13.438 --> 02:15.106
