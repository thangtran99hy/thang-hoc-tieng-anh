Do you have any plans this weekend?

00:07.731 --> 00:08.107
Yes.

00:08.199 --> 00:10.207
I'm planning to visit my parents.

00:12.906 --> 00:15.174
Would you like to join us for dinner this evening?

00:15.886 --> 00:16.890
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:17.061 --> 00:18.659
I have to go home early today.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.865
Was your sister at the supermarket this morning?

00:24.108 --> 00:25.389
I think I saw her there.

00:26.095 --> 00:27.069
Yes, she was.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.417
She said she was going to buy some fruit.

00:32.339 --> 00:33.463
Here are your keys.

When are you going to move into the new house?

00:37.096 --> 00:41.080
Not soon, but we are planning to move later this year.
