00:00.934 --> 00:04.259
Iran has sentenced to death three more people...

00:04.354 --> 00:07.917
...accused of killing members of the security forces during anti-government protests.

00:08.478 --> 00:11.591
The crackdown has had a chilling effect on the protest movement...

00:11.676 --> 00:14.226
...which has largely subsided in recent weeks.

00:14.767 --> 00:17.409
But, as the government proceeds with executions,...

00:17.666 --> 00:20.013
...anger towards the regime continues to grow.

00:22.391 --> 00:25.815
It's the nights Iranians are most afraid of these days...

00:25.976 --> 00:29.535
...because that's when the Islamic Republic carries out executions...

00:29.657 --> 00:31.707
...in prisons like this one in Karaj.

00:33.837 --> 00:37.323
People are gathering here to show their support for the inmates.

00:38.937 --> 00:43.031
Among the crowd, the parents of one of the prisoners, Mohammad Ghobadlou.

00:43.393 --> 00:45.951
The 22 year old has been sentenced to death...

00:46.063 --> 00:51.257
...and transferred to solitary confinement along with 18 year old Mohammad Boroughani,...

00:51.681 --> 00:55.631
...for allegedly killing a member of the Islamic Republic's Armed Forces.

00:56.688 --> 00:59.331
Ghobadlou's mother says the trial was a sham...

00:59.541 --> 01:02.193
...and that her son had nothing to do with the incident.

01:04.661 --> 01:05.989
Everybody knows that.

01:06.095 --> 01:09.145
They deliberately put this in my son's prosecution file,...

01:09.365 --> 01:10.895
...with the aim of hurting my son.

01:11.021 --> 01:11.850
That's not right.

01:12.087 --> 01:13.574
They're committing an injustice.

01:17.819 --> 01:22.305
Experts agree, quoting official documents from the case leaked in October.

01:22.997 --> 01:25.473
One of these two men that you just mentioned, Mohammad Ghobadlou,...

01:25.831 --> 01:28.441
...his court documents were leaked in October.

01:28.567 --> 01:32.103
And even there, just one week after he was arrested,...

01:32.199 --> 01:35.783
...you could see that the regime said we need to execute him...

01:35.900 --> 01:39.797
...and we need to expedite this whole process so that he can be executed.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.249
And that was before any, any court proceeding, before anything even happened.

01:44.348 --> 01:49.928
So, we can see that these executions are just purely to intimidate people to stop the protests.
