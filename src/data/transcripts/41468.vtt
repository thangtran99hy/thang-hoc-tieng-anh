00:01.072 --> 00:02.356
Okay, you want to learn about the future?

00:02.508 --> 00:03.679
The future is now...

00:03.756 --> 00:08.329
...because this morning, a new artificial intelligence tool known as ChatGPT...

00:08.567 --> 00:12.963
...has gained popularity for its ability to craft emails, write research papers,...

00:13.207 --> 00:15.840
...and answer almost any question in a matter of seconds.

00:16.194 --> 00:18.774
It is a powerful new technology with extraordinary potential...

00:18.900 --> 00:23.431
...but there are also warnings about the huge risk of misuse.

00:23.965 --> 00:25.055
You know, who knows all about this?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.741
Vanessa Yurkevich, she joins us now.

00:28.935 --> 00:29.885
Good morning.

00:30.219 --> 00:31.337
Sounds interesting.

00:31.477 --> 00:33.457
Proceed, but with caution.

00:33.592 --> 00:35.081
Intriguing, certainly.

00:35.156 --> 00:39.440
And a lot of AI analysts say it's as revolutionary as the internet,...

00:39.758 --> 00:41.692
...but some say it's a threat to society.

00:41.771 --> 00:45.143
But one thing is for sure, it's sparking interest among everyone...

00:45.233 --> 00:47.684
...from top CEOs to students.

00:53.567 --> 00:57.625
ChatGPT, short for Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer,...

00:57.723 --> 01:01.183
...is a machine learning model that can generate humanlike text.

01:01.509 --> 01:03.916
It's been trained on a massive amount of data,...

01:04.185 --> 01:09.656
...allowing it to understand and respond to a wide range of questions and prompts.

01:10.467 --> 01:13.091
What you just heard me reading wasn't written by me.

01:13.175 --> 01:17.346
It was written by artificial intelligence, ChatGPT.

01:18.699 --> 01:20.297
I simply typed in a prompt:...

01:20.456 --> 01:24.518
"Write a TV news script written by a reporter about ChatGPT."

01:25.008 --> 01:28.741
And in just seconds, the AI spit out the copy you just heard.

01:28.995 --> 01:32.915
ChatGPT has exploded in popularity in recent months.

01:33.173 --> 01:35.573
CEOs are now using it to write emails.

01:35.843 --> 01:38.820
It even passed a Wharton School of Business exam.

01:39.602 --> 01:43.676
Should people be more excited about ChatGPT or more fearful of it?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.110
I think we should have a mixed view.

01:46.591 --> 01:51.961
OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT, says the technology is still in its research phase...

01:52.065 --> 01:54.846
...and can produce inaccurate information.

01:55.380 --> 01:59.455
You like artificial intelligence, but are you here to issue a warning about it?

01:59.759 --> 02:00.280
Absolutely.

02:00.344 --> 02:02.765
Artificial intelligence is sort of like a teenager right now.

02:02.887 --> 02:06.664
It's exciting to see the teenager, like, get its footing.

02:06.987 --> 02:09.555
But it's also not there yet and we can't trust it.

02:09.985 --> 02:13.811
But Microsoft thinks it's a good bet, even with some risks.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.387
They're investing billions of dollars in OpenAI.
