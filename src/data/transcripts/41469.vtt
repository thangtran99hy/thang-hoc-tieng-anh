00:00.336 --> 00:04.969
Disability activists in South Korea are being sued by the subway authority...

00:05.047 --> 00:08.459
…for causing major disruption in Seoul in the morning rush hour.

00:08.735 --> 00:12.551
Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination say they want all stations...

00:12.619 --> 00:13.806
...to be wheelchair accessible.

00:14.257 --> 00:18.019
And more funding allocated to disability provisions in the national budget.

00:18.346 --> 00:22.983
But the authority's hardline response has led to a bitter feud and clashes...

00:23.349 --> 00:25.499
…between demonstrators and security forces.

00:25.782 --> 00:29.110
Nick Marsh's report from the capital contains scenes...

00:29.189 --> 00:31.329
…that some viewers may find distressing.

00:34.797 --> 00:37.665
In Seoul, there's a battle happening at rush hour.

00:39.921 --> 00:45.073
Underground, disabled South Koreans want equal access to their city subway system.

00:45.488 --> 00:48.663
Blocking train doors and shaving their heads in protest.

00:51.825 --> 00:56.640
Seoul's mayor has vowed zero tolerance, but it hasn't stopped the demonstrations.

00:59.412 --> 01:01.124
I've been hit by commuters.

01:01.338 --> 01:02.539
I've been followed home.

01:03.157 --> 01:04.315
People shout at us.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.270
They say, "why don't you stay at home?"

01:07.782 --> 01:12.763
But the gap between disabled and non disabled people here is so huge,...

01:13.079 --> 01:14.307
…that we have to continue.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.423
Among commuters though, sympathy is in short supply.

01:23.013 --> 01:26.136
I was one hour late from a hospital appointment because of this.

01:26.567 --> 01:29.008
Why would it have to cause harm to innocent citizens?

01:31.900 --> 01:32.671
Look at all this.

01:33.138 --> 01:35.473
How many facilities the disabled already have?

01:35.989 --> 01:37.063
I agree with the police.

01:39.282 --> 01:42.683
The people here say they want to be able to get around their own city,...

01:42.865 --> 01:44.206
…just like everybody else.

01:44.645 --> 01:47.738
But the way they've gone about it hasn't exactly won them...

01:47.834 --> 01:50.116
…many friends from commuters.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.943
Then again, neither has the response from the authorities.

01:53.024 --> 01:56.539
It's been pretty quiet here this morning and yet the people here...

01:56.822 --> 02:01.470
…have been outnumbered by police and riot police by about five to one.

02:01.929 --> 02:02.810
It's not a great look.
