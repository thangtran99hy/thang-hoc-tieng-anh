Roger Federer made $600 million off of the tennis court.

00:04.051 --> 00:04.327
How?

00:04.753 --> 00:06.496
He was one of the most dominant tennis players of all time.

00:06.677 --> 00:08.099
So he won like, 20 Grand Slam titles.

00:08.226 --> 00:11.464
But at Nike, where he was, he wasn't one of their priority athletes.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.175
When they came back to renew his contract, they gave him ten mil a year.

00:15.311 --> 00:18.591
So he took a risk and left the brand because of one word...

00:18.748 --> 00:23.425
...that made his contract worth 60 times more money because of this decision.

00:23.581 --> 00:25.087
So Federer went to Uniqlo.

00:25.244 --> 00:26.281
No one knew who they were.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.475
Everybody thought he was crazy.

00:27.589 --> 00:28.179
Why do you do that?

00:28.271 --> 00:30.691
Because he said, "Skip your straight contract.

00:30.805 --> 00:32.296
Give me equity."

00:32.490 --> 00:35.126
Roger got a 3% equity stake in the brand.

00:35.347 --> 00:36.605
The company later went public,...

00:36.741 --> 00:41.339
...and Roger's stake grew from 20 million to $600 million today.

00:41.495 --> 00:44.792
That's how deal making makes millionaires and billionaires.

00:44.906 --> 00:46.151
It's the power of betting on yourself.

00:46.313 --> 00:46.785
Sure.

00:46.899 --> 00:50.455
But it's knowing my favorite five-letter word: terms.
