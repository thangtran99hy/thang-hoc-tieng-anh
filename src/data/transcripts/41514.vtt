Hi, everybody, it's Paul.

00:01.045 --> 00:02.397
You know, a lot of people ask me,...

00:02.683 --> 00:05.550
...after a long day of voice-over or writing...

00:05.690 --> 00:07.929
...or doing all those creative things that I do,...

00:09.101 --> 00:10.061
...how do I relax?

00:10.223 --> 00:16.053
Well, like many other Americans, I come home and I pet my dog.

00:16.551 --> 00:17.878
You see, petting your dog...

00:18.019 --> 00:21.447
...is one of the most relaxing things you can possibly do.

00:21.789 --> 00:27.445
It releases a hormone called oxytocin, which reduces stress.

00:27.939 --> 00:32.810
Also, it lowers your heart rate and it lowers your blood pressure.

00:33.171 --> 00:34.825
Plus, people who pet their dogs...

00:35.217 --> 00:38.533
...are five times more likely to live longer...

00:38.651 --> 00:40.338
...than people who just have cats.

00:41.007 --> 00:43.291
Plus, the dogs like it so much.

00:43.475 --> 00:45.398
And that's a nice bonding experience.

00:46.705 --> 00:47.222
That's right.

00:47.939 --> 00:49.052
Who's Daddy's little boy?

00:49.196 --> 00:50.197
Daddy's little boy.

00:50.565 --> 00:51.628
Daddy's little boy.

00:51.732 --> 00:52.377
That's right.

01:03.295 --> 01:04.077
Okay, we're done.
