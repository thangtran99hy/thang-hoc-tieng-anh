00:01.514 --> 00:02.386
Good morning, guys.

00:02.513 --> 00:04.813
I'll get to the point right away.

00:05.434 --> 00:07.797
I'm retiring for good.

00:08.931 --> 00:11.951
I know the process was a pretty big deal last time,...

00:12.104 --> 00:15.840
...so when I woke up this morning, I figured I just press record...

00:15.994 --> 00:17.399
...and let you guys know first...

00:17.552 --> 00:19.685
...so it won't be long-winded.

00:20.317 --> 00:24.062
You only get one super emotional retirement essay,...

00:24.214 --> 00:25.441
...and I used mine up last year.

00:25.612 --> 00:32.589
So really, thank you guys so much, to every single one of you for supporting me;...

00:32.860 --> 00:38.825
...my family, my friends, my teammates, my competitors.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.496
I could go on forever, there's too many.

00:43.049 --> 00:45.900
Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream.

00:46.569 --> 00:49.473
I wouldn't change a thing.

00:50.319 --> 00:51.179
Love you all.
