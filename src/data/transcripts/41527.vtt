00:00.952 --> 00:03.785
But right now, major breaking news in the sports world,...

00:03.909 --> 00:08.243
...King James is the new points king of the NBA.

00:08.382 --> 00:11.213
Los Angeles Lakers superstar, LeBron James,...

00:11.307 --> 00:14.530
...has just become the league's all-time leading scorer.

00:14.874 --> 00:17.861
James scoring 36 points tonight so far.

00:18.356 --> 00:19.526
The game is still going on.

00:19.715 --> 00:24.400
What he has done is passed fellow Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar...

00:24.457 --> 00:29.221
...to claim the record, which Abdul-Jabbar held since 1984...

00:29.335 --> 00:32.065
...and who's in attendance for tonight's game.

00:32.371 --> 00:34.125
What that moment was like?

00:35.437 --> 00:38.989
Honestly, watching the aftermath of that moment right now...

00:39.082 --> 00:40.762
...is incredibly surreal.

00:40.865 --> 00:44.241
Everybody here in the arena was on their feet, waiting,...

00:44.561 --> 00:48.338
...in bated breath for the anticipation of that shot going in.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.399
And it was one of his signature fade away shots going from the left elbow.

00:52.715 --> 00:54.353
And he absolutely drained it.

00:54.469 --> 00:57.698
Ran back towards center court with his hands up in the air.

00:57.997 --> 01:02.457
His entire family, his close friends, cheering him on.

01:02.581 --> 01:04.736
They're now on the court with him, celebrating,...

01:04.998 --> 01:10.477
...embracing, some of them feel, or look, I should say, very emotional in this moment.

01:10.749 --> 01:14.034
It's a record that many people never thought would be broken.

01:14.159 --> 01:20.219
We're talking more than 38,000 career points at the highest level of basketball...

01:20.456 --> 01:25.811
...over the course of an NBA career that spanned 20 years for LeBron James.

01:25.936 --> 01:33.241
And now he stands at center court as fans chant "MVP" as the arena plays a montage...

01:33.365 --> 01:37.035
...of what is essentially him collecting Infinity Stones..

01:37.128 --> 01:38.648
...over the course of his career.

01:39.053 --> 01:42.762
And it could not be a more proud moment for the fans,...

01:43.051 --> 01:45.129
...for his family looking on from right in front of him,...

01:45.189 --> 01:49.053
...and, of course, for the NBA, as Kareem now embraces him,...

01:49.299 --> 01:53.129
...passing one milestone, handing it off to the next generation.
