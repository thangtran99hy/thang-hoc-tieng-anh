I've been so, so inspired by every artist in this category with me at...

00:09.115 --> 00:10.566
...a lot of different times in my life.

00:10.817 --> 00:13.937
I listen to everyone in this category when I'm alone...

00:14.108 --> 00:18.995
...and I think, like, on nights like tonight,...

00:19.245 --> 00:21.723
...it's obviously so important for us to remember...

00:21.853 --> 00:25.737
...that there is no such thing as best in music.

00:26.349 --> 00:30.421
I don't think any of us sit in the studio thinking, making decisions...

00:30.551 --> 00:32.623
...based on what is going to get us one of these.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.981
This is really, really kind.

00:35.207 --> 00:36.481
I'm so, so grateful.

00:36.691 --> 00:39.089
I'm going to pass it over to my collaborators...

00:39.300 --> 00:46.755
...who are, I'm just so, this doesn't happen to people like me very often...

00:46.886 --> 00:48.433
...and this is so, so nice.

00:48.571 --> 00:49.645
Thank you very, very much.
