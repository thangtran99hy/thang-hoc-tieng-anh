Now, a crackdown against the LGBT+ community in Russia has intensified...

00:04.201 --> 00:07.061
...after a tough new law was passed by the Russian Parliament.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.755
The bill passed back in December places restrictions...

00:09.828 --> 00:13.019
...on almost any mention of LGBT people or culture.

00:13.411 --> 00:14.081
Here's Will Vernon.

00:16.231 --> 00:19.974
When he leaves the house, Danya can't wear makeup.

00:20.485 --> 00:23.418
But even then, he still feels afraid.

00:24.827 --> 00:28.951
It's very frightening living somewhere where it's illegal to just be yourself.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.517
I don't want to live in fear.

00:31.464 --> 00:35.395
The 22 year old does something that can be very dangerous in Russia.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.776
He's an openly gay drag queen.

00:40.795 --> 00:44.658
But now, Danya plans to leave the country and move to France.

00:45.153 --> 00:49.360
A new anti LGBT law has been passed by the Russian Parliament.

00:49.900 --> 00:54.007
The main drag night Danya performs at has canceled its shows.

00:55.567 --> 00:58.383
According to the law, it's forbidden to do what we do now.

00:59.169 --> 01:00.577
I have to either leave the country...

01:00.661 --> 01:03.691
...or stay here and wait for things to get even worse.

01:04.633 --> 01:10.059
10 years ago, so-called gay propaganda was made illegal in relation to children.

01:10.657 --> 01:13.017
But the new measures go much further.

01:13.915 --> 01:18.667
Many are worried that even the slightest reference to LGBT culture...

01:18.882 --> 01:20.022
...will now be banned.

01:21.389 --> 01:23.904
Well, I've just bought this book recently published.

01:23.993 --> 01:29.273
It's a gay love story, but if you look inside you can see that parts of it...

01:29.360 --> 01:30.986
...have actually been redacted.

01:32.219 --> 01:35.827
And shops right across Russia have been withdrawing other books from sale.

01:35.999 --> 01:38.606
Books with gay references or characters in them...

01:38.900 --> 01:40.946
...in case they get prosecuted under the new law.

01:41.653 --> 01:46.377
It's almost as if LGBT people are being deleted from society.
