When we think about national security threats,...

00:03.399 --> 00:06.505
...the first thing to come to mind probably isn't a phone app...

00:06.813 --> 00:12.024
...but the head of the CIA is worried about just that, with the app TikTok.

00:14.288 --> 00:18.392
I mean, I think it is a genuine concern, I think for the U.S. Government.

00:18.721 --> 00:23.589
In the sense that because the parent company of TikTok is a Chinese company.

00:24.260 --> 00:31.096
The Chinese government is able to insist upon extracting the private data...

00:31.189 --> 00:33.471
...of a lot of TikTok users in this country.

00:33.789 --> 00:37.751
And also to shape the content of what goes on to TikTok as well,...

00:38.093 --> 00:40.183
...to suit the interests of the Chinese leadership.

00:40.266 --> 00:42.434
I think those are real challenges.

00:44.086 --> 00:47.563
Burns calls it, quote, "troubling" and warns families to be, quote,...

00:47.651 --> 00:51.069
..."really careful", in his words, "when it comes to kids using TikTok".

00:51.513 --> 00:55.649
Nearly 20 states now banned TikTok on their government devices or networks.

00:55.957 --> 00:59.545
Virginia, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming are among the latest.

00:59.900 --> 01:00.961
And right here in Washington,...

01:01.033 --> 01:05.489
...the Senate this week passed the same kind of ban for federal devices.

01:05.782 --> 01:07.846
But it is not clear if the House will do anything.

01:08.205 --> 01:12.996
The U.S. Military, the State Department, and Homeland Security are all limiting TikTok.

01:13.254 --> 01:15.171
So, what about the rest of us?

01:15.519 --> 01:18.268
Tech reporter, Stephanie Humphrey, joins us now.

01:18.351 --> 01:21.729
All right, so, Stephanie, why are these officials and tech security experts...

01:21.807 --> 01:25.359
...saying we need to get TikTok off our phones and tablets?

01:26.594 --> 01:29.805
Well, I think the main reason, thank you for having me, by the way.

01:29.900 --> 01:34.197
I think the main reason is because TikTok's parent company, ByteDance,...

01:34.473 --> 01:36.185
...is a Chinese company.

01:36.279 --> 01:39.001
They are based in Singapore, currently.

01:39.325 --> 01:45.085
And they do have to comply with the Chinese government's request for personal data...

01:45.190 --> 01:47.659
...if the Chinese government was to make that request.

01:47.753 --> 01:49.593
They would be compelled to comply with that.

01:49.671 --> 01:55.706
So, the idea that federal employees, or government employees in general,...

01:56.005 --> 01:58.935
...could have TikTok on their work phones...

01:59.194 --> 02:01.516
...and have information on those phones be compromised...

02:01.614 --> 02:05.009
...is a valid concern, I think, for people in this country.
