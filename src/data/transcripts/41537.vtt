00:00.233 --> 00:03.229
International finance is on the precipice.

00:03.378 --> 00:09.151
The World Bank says the global economy is perilously close to falling into recession.

00:09.558 --> 00:12.690
War in Ukraine and the continuing effects of the pandemic...

00:12.781 --> 00:17.220
…mean it has significantly downgraded its expectations for this year.

00:17.651 --> 00:23.748
The global economy is projected to grow by just 1.7 percent in 2023.

00:23.821 --> 00:26.223
The slowest growth for over three decades.

00:26.601 --> 00:29.725
2024 isn't looking much better.

00:30.005 --> 00:34.681
Franziska Ohnsorge from the World Bank told us that more developed nations...

00:34.810 --> 00:37.199
…are on course for a particularly bad year.

00:39.184 --> 00:43.199
By our forecast, slowdowns in advanced economy growth...

00:43.437 --> 00:47.081
…are steeper than in emerging markets and developing economy growth.

00:47.367 --> 00:51.101
In advanced economy, the policy tightening that's currently underway...

00:52.094 --> 00:54.009
...is sharply weighing on growth.

00:54.105 --> 00:56.270
It is much necessary, much needed...

00:56.660 --> 00:59.803
…because inflation has turned out to be much higher for much longer...

00:59.868 --> 01:03.439
…than we had anticipated in even just six months ago.

01:03.513 --> 01:06.098
Six months ago we expected a consensus forecast.

01:06.178 --> 01:10.420
Expected inflation in advanced economies in 2023...

01:10.481 --> 01:13.708
...to be not that far off inflation targets of 2%.

01:14.099 --> 01:18.742
At this point, inflation is expected to be around 5%, double that.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.232
So, of course, central banks are tightening policy.

01:21.306 --> 01:23.983
Have to tighten policy more than anticipated.

01:24.271 --> 01:25.923
And that is weighing on growth.
