I'm just wearing my dead boyfriend's shirt and texting his old number.

00:04.849 --> 00:06.905
Rob wanted to make sure you got one of these.

00:07.094 --> 00:07.595
I have a phone.

00:07.712 --> 00:08.626
You have a personal phone.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.564
This is a work phone.

00:11.236 --> 00:12.308
I miss you so much.

00:12.441 --> 00:13.833
There's an aching inside of me.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.636
Do you have a question for me?

00:16.813 --> 00:17.755
Yes, Ms. Dion.

00:17.927 --> 00:19.619
Do you really believe in all these things you sing?

00:19.822 --> 00:22.232
You obviously know nothing about it.

00:22.465 --> 00:22.771
What?

00:23.187 --> 00:23.585
Love.

00:26.644 --> 00:28.492
It's been two years since you passed...

00:28.772 --> 00:29.918
...and I still can't believe it.

00:30.084 --> 00:31.475
Who is sending me these texts?

00:31.613 --> 00:34.439
Every morning I open my eyes hoping I'll still see you.

00:34.789 --> 00:36.287
I must have the dead boyfriend's number.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.417
That's super sad.

00:37.567 --> 00:38.413
I think they're nice.

00:39.512 --> 00:40.474
Remember that yellow dress?

00:40.687 --> 00:42.182
I'm wearing it to the opera tonight.

00:42.287 --> 00:43.176
I gotta go see her.

00:43.301 --> 00:44.648
These are from a literal stranger.

00:44.815 --> 00:46.834
I just need to put a face to these texts.

00:51.896 --> 00:52.610
Do I know you?

00:53.093 --> 00:53.791
I'm not sure.

00:54.406 --> 00:55.209
Oh my God.

00:55.353 --> 00:57.494
You just got yourself a date the normal way.

00:58.412 --> 00:59.631
Oh, I was looking forward to this.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.001
I just felt like I knew you or something.

01:02.704 --> 01:05.164
Do you think you could fall in love with someone just through their words?

01:06.079 --> 01:07.254
I think you're very cute.

01:11.442 --> 01:13.649
The more I get to know her, the better I like her.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.147
Things like this don't just happen.

01:23.990 --> 01:27.318
Love has a plan for each and everyone of us.
