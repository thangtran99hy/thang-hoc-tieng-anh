00:00.040 --> 00:05.297
To solve climate change, we need to get rid of every area of emission.

00:05.499 --> 00:08.816
People think a lot about electricity and transportation,...

00:09.349 --> 00:12.028
...but a lot less about buildings.

00:12.358 --> 00:16.027
The challenge is not just how we build new buildings,...

00:16.417 --> 00:19.098
...but what we do with all the buildings we have now.

00:19.357 --> 00:24.027
So, one great innovation in this space is about windows.

00:24.327 --> 00:28.221
Today's windows let the heat come in or the heat go out.

00:28.386 --> 00:31.795
You have to run your heater during the winter a lot more.

00:32.235 --> 00:33.317
It costs you money.

00:33.507 --> 00:34.699
It's bad for climate change.

00:35.192 --> 00:36.543
Well, so what Luxwall did,...

00:36.983 --> 00:38.970
...as they said, can we make a window...

00:39.512 --> 00:42.499
...that has a couple of layers of vacuum in there...

00:42.918 --> 00:49.978
...that block the heat and so your house stays warm with far, far less energy?

00:50.398 --> 00:52.389
Another company, AeroSeal,...

00:52.526 --> 00:56.328
...has a solution for the problem of buildings leaking energy.

00:56.459 --> 01:00.721
Other than through windows, the walls and ducts of your house...

01:00.884 --> 01:05.843
...have a lot of leaks, little cracks that the air is flowing in and out of.

01:05.976 --> 01:07.837
And again, that raises your heating bill,...

01:07.957 --> 01:09.737
...which is bad for climate change.

01:10.331 --> 01:14.202
Their very clever solution is they simply take polymer,...

01:14.421 --> 01:19.337
...very sticky, special polymer, and they literally blow it.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.262
And so it finds those cracks...

01:22.417 --> 01:26.298
...and it kind of sticks to the edge of the cracks and creates a seal.

01:26.607 --> 01:27.863
So, these are two innovations...

01:28.047 --> 01:31.179
...that are dealing with the toughest part of building emissions...

01:31.559 --> 01:34.635
...taking existing buildings, saving you money,...

01:34.965 --> 01:37.003
...and reducing the climate burden.
