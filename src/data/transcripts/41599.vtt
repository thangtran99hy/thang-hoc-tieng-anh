Before I die, I definitely want Japan to be more gender equal...

00:04.619 --> 00:09.357
...and people are happier because there aren't that many social expectations,...

00:09.541 --> 00:10.797
...especially gender expectations.

00:10.999 --> 00:11.642
That's my goal.

00:11.873 --> 00:13.207
One way to do this,...

00:13.333 --> 00:15.983
...I think a very effective way to do this is...

00:16.096 --> 00:18.053
...getting more men to take paternity leave.

00:18.187 --> 00:22.273
Only 7% of fathers in 2020 took paternity leave,...

00:22.442 --> 00:23.748
...even though Japan has...

00:23.952 --> 00:26.549
...one of the most generous parental leave systems in the world,...

00:26.637 --> 00:28.690
...better than Scandinavian countries.

00:28.882 --> 00:32.819
So what I mean by that is both mothers and fathers...

00:33.042 --> 00:36.885
...can get paid by the government up to twelve months of parental leave.

00:37.031 --> 00:37.945
And it's guaranteed.

00:38.119 --> 00:41.522
So, if you submit it to your employer, basically you can get it...

00:41.687 --> 00:45.426
...as long as you have at least one year of employment with that employer.

00:45.543 --> 00:48.371
You might think like, okay, if it's guaranteed,...

00:48.581 --> 00:51.069
...why isn't everyone taking it?

00:51.305 --> 00:52.355
Social pressure, right?

00:52.533 --> 00:56.302
I told you before we started filming, I'm on my paternity leave right now...

00:56.710 --> 00:58.375
...and I'm taking time off of work.

00:58.655 --> 01:00.441
If you asked me a few years ago...

01:00.593 --> 01:04.272
...if I was going to take this much time off when I had my first child,...

01:04.418 --> 01:05.695
...I don't know if I would have said yes...

01:05.995 --> 01:09.239
...because I had this mindset of, I'm a man.

01:09.418 --> 01:11.181
I'm supposed to provide for the family.

01:11.624 --> 01:13.999
I need to work harder so I can earn more...

01:14.255 --> 01:16.353
....and I can provide for the family, right?

01:16.576 --> 01:17.484
But I let it go.

01:17.669 --> 01:23.985
I let go of the mindset and a lot more freedom of how I can live my life.
