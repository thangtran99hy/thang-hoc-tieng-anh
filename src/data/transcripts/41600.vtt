Oh, America is this, in Europe it's this,...

00:02.909 --> 00:04.568
...then we should be like this.

00:04.712 --> 00:07.588
Why do we have to become like other countries?

00:07.786 --> 00:09.068
That's actually a good point.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.079
If Japan wants to change,...

00:11.227 --> 00:14.748
...it shouldn't be just because Japan is not like the West.

00:14.913 --> 00:17.329
I personally don't get this kind of argument...

00:17.461 --> 00:19.981
...because just getting closer to the West...

00:20.320 --> 00:22.772
...doesn't mean women in Japan become happier.

00:23.013 --> 00:26.270
Having said that, of course, it does not mean either;...

00:26.595 --> 00:28.785
...Japan doesn't need to change anything.

00:29.111 --> 00:31.214
So, what do we need to change?

00:31.326 --> 00:33.046
One of the most important things...

00:33.225 --> 00:36.435
...is having females in leadership positions.

00:36.597 --> 00:38.436
People in the senior leadership positions...

00:38.699 --> 00:41.083
...regardless of whether you're running a country...

00:41.252 --> 00:43.054
...or whether you're running an organization,...

00:43.197 --> 00:48.661
...that group gets to make the policies or rules or laws of that country...

00:48.771 --> 00:50.157
...or the organization, right?

00:50.297 --> 00:52.317
And that affects everyone under them.

00:52.488 --> 00:56.903
If those policies are made by just one type of group, just men,...

00:57.096 --> 01:00.841
...those rules and policies are designed to fit men.

01:00.957 --> 01:05.405
I think it's super important to have diverse perspectives at the leadership level...

01:05.605 --> 01:10.545
...so that whatever the policies that they try to design, are more inclusive.
