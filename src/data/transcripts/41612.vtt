00:09.174 --> 00:10.761
Welcome to Global Japan.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.911
In this edition, we're off to Jordan,...

00:13.167 --> 00:16.811
...home to one of the largest populations of Syrian refugees in the world.

00:17.031 --> 00:21.245
One and a half hours drive from Amman and just 12 kilometers from Syria...

00:21.539 --> 00:23.056
...lies the camp of Zaatari.

00:23.343 --> 00:26.202
We're here to see how Japan is helping rebuild a life...

00:26.305 --> 00:27.679
...for those who've lost everything.

00:28.366 --> 00:29.953
Naseem is 22.

00:30.169 --> 00:31.355
He has three children.

00:31.715 --> 00:33.058
He's been living here with his family...

00:33.115 --> 00:35.763
...since fleeing his war-torn country in 2012.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.234
In Syria, Naseem owned a small multimedia shop.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.173
He's about to start training as an electrician.

00:44.846 --> 00:47.801
Thanks to electricity, we're able to communicate with the outside world,...

00:47.897 --> 00:49.101
...with our families in Syria.

00:49.351 --> 00:51.209
It's important; we need electricity.

00:51.298 --> 00:53.108
It's the basis of a civilized society.

00:56.196 --> 00:59.362
The Jordanian National Electricity Company runs the training here...

00:59.443 --> 01:02.511
...together with the Japan International Cooperation Agency...

01:02.765 --> 01:04.410
...and the UN Refugee Agency.

01:04.985 --> 01:07.778
The goal is to teach trainees to connect homes to the grid,...

01:07.960 --> 01:10.614
...repair and maintain the infrastructure and improve safety.

01:10.950 --> 01:13.478
A total of 200 refugees will undergo training.

01:15.232 --> 01:16.952
At the Zaatari refugee camp,...

01:17.036 --> 01:20.623
...each inhabitant is entitled to 35 liters of water per day.

01:21.299 --> 01:24.185
Hashim supervises the distribution in his neighborhood.

01:24.372 --> 01:28.509
A Syrian refugee himself, he works as a volunteer for the Japanese NGO, JEN,...

01:28.854 --> 01:32.132
...and has been appointed by his neighbors to fulfill this fundamental mission.

01:32.554 --> 01:35.527
Safe drinking water, basic sanitation and hygiene,...

01:35.897 --> 01:38.989
...these are the driving principles of UNICEF's WASH program...

01:39.164 --> 01:42.931
...in more than 100 countries around the world, including here in Zaatari,...

01:43.159 --> 01:45.767
...under the supervision of JEN and other NGOs.

01:46.205 --> 01:48.758
Eventually, water will no longer be delivered by lorry,...

01:49.005 --> 01:50.849
...but through a proper distribution network.

01:51.543 --> 01:54.531
Providing the water network for the people,...

01:54.935 --> 02:00.211
...it's to make the camp more sustainable and more healthy.

02:01.575 --> 02:03.379
We think it's very, very important.

02:05.456 --> 02:09.034
In all, JEN has offered training and jobs to 200 people in the camp,...

02:09.512 --> 02:13.625
...the ultimate goal being to mobilize the community and empower the refugees.
