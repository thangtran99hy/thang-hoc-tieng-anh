Brewing sake has always been a family business,...

00:10.250 --> 00:13.397
...and I watched my family work ever since I was a child.

00:15.081 --> 00:19.343
It took me over 15 years to make sake that I can appreciate.

00:21.118 --> 00:25.701
As a brewmaster, I value the skill that goes into making sake.

00:27.673 --> 00:30.721
Our process is traditional and innovative,...

00:32.733 --> 00:37.328
...reflecting Hiroshima's nature, tastes and its people.

00:38.068 --> 00:40.676
I'm inspired to show my home spirit.

00:41.115 --> 00:43.799
I strongly believe the sake we create...

00:44.105 --> 00:46.215
...will shed more light on Hiroshima...

00:46.463 --> 00:48.957
...and Japan's rich, traditional culture.

00:49.898 --> 00:54.246
I am looking forward to seeing more people engage with the true Hiroshima.

00:54.613 --> 00:57.185
My story is here in Hiroshima.
