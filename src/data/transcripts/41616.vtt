Overwork in Japan is a real problem and a deadly one at that.

00:04.667 --> 00:06.349
There is even a Japanese word for it,...

00:06.559 --> 00:09.445
..."karoshi" meaning "death from overwork."

00:09.925 --> 00:12.873
It's a problem that affects Japan's teachers in particular.

00:13.292 --> 00:15.825
They are expected to not just teach their students...

00:15.897 --> 00:18.833
...but also lead them during after-school activities,...

00:19.195 --> 00:21.067
...cleaning duties and mentoring.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.511
One investigation found school teachers...

00:23.623 --> 00:28.354
...working an average of 123 hours overtime each month,...

00:28.761 --> 00:32.812
...well above the government-defined karoshi line of 80 hours,...

00:33.227 --> 00:36.239
...essentially meaning a high risk of death from overwork...

00:36.503 --> 00:40.174
...if one works more than 80 overtime hours a month.

00:40.444 --> 00:44.125
For some teachers, though, that risk does turn real.

00:46.001 --> 00:51.315
A brain hemorrhage killed middle school teacher Yoshio Kudo in 2007...

00:51.608 --> 00:52.943
...at just 40 years of age.

00:53.379 --> 00:57.357
His diary entries told of a punishing workday that started early...

00:57.453 --> 00:59.459
...and could last until nearly midnight.

01:00.221 --> 01:02.839
Teachers are particularly vulnerable to karoshi.

01:03.315 --> 01:06.935
A decades-old law essentially prevents them from being paid for overtime.

01:08.017 --> 01:10.210
His widow, a former teacher herself,...

01:10.724 --> 01:14.399
...says attitudes to karoshi need to change.

01:16.191 --> 01:18.409
For about a year before he passed away,...

01:18.717 --> 01:22.432
...he would often say how tired he was and how bad a headache he had...

01:23.131 --> 01:27.318
...from when he moved to the new school in April until he died two months later.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.217
He kept saying he was exhausted.

01:29.449 --> 01:31.125
He said he wanted to leave the school.
