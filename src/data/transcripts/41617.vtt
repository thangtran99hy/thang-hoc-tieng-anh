What do we know about the vehicles impacted, Graham?

00:02.928 --> 00:07.999
The vehicles impacted right now, NHTSA is saying it's a rare issue.

00:08.083 --> 00:15.060
But it is about a few dozen models of Model S, Model 3, Model X...

00:15.127 --> 00:19.832
...and Model Y vehicles between 2016 and 2023.

00:20.125 --> 00:26.650
So, any Tesla vehicle produced in the last seven years is, you know,...

00:26.759 --> 00:28.129
...could be considered part of this recall.

00:28.347 --> 00:30.489
And I do recommend that if you own one of these vehicles,...

00:30.567 --> 00:33.705
...to go on the NHTSA website and see if your vehicle is affected.

00:34.619 --> 00:39.683
You know, a lot of our audience out there on Twitter, on other social platforms...

00:39.751 --> 00:42.223
...like Instagram, they're saying why are you guys jumping on this?

00:42.300 --> 00:43.126
It's a software fix.

00:43.206 --> 00:44.528
Why are you calling it a recall?

00:44.887 --> 00:47.497
Well according to NHTSA, it is a technical recall...

00:47.785 --> 00:50.313
...but the other point that we make in our reporting, right,...

00:50.401 --> 00:56.153
...is that Elon Musk has talked about how central FSD is to Tesla's valuation.

00:56.321 --> 00:58.417
That's what he's talked about in the past.

00:58.646 --> 00:59.244
Absolutely.

00:59.317 --> 01:02.117
This is really about where he sees the company.

01:02.378 --> 01:08.309
And as we've reported before, what is marketed as full self-driving or autopilot...

01:08.607 --> 01:11.601
...often comes into conflict with the reality of the situation.

01:11.704 --> 01:15.450
The company itself says on its website that full self-driving and autopilot...

01:15.554 --> 01:18.766
...should not be enabled without drivers attention.

01:18.947 --> 01:21.850
That the driver should always keep their hands available to take over.

01:22.861 --> 01:26.038
And this marketing and even the labeling of full self-driving...

01:26.114 --> 01:30.267
...has had people and critics and agencies complain about this.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.211
This is also part of an ongoing investigation...

01:33.281 --> 01:38.383
...that NHTSA has had into the company's autopilot and full self-driving technology.

01:38.470 --> 01:42.834
So, this is a real risk for the company should this have any more faults...

01:42.901 --> 01:46.147
...and be something that the U.S. government is investigating...

01:46.207 --> 01:47.136
...a little bit more seriously.
