00:00.177 --> 00:03.825
Now, the world's biggest trial of a four-day working week has ended in success,...

00:03.900 --> 00:06.534
...with the performance of companies largely unharmed...

00:06.604 --> 00:08.699
...and workers feeling healthier and happier.

00:09.167 --> 00:12.459
61 businesses across Britain took part in the study.

00:12.588 --> 00:13.850
Emma Simpson reports.

00:15.424 --> 00:20.629
This is what a Friday looks like in environmental consultancy firm, Tyler Grange.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.448
All the staff are off.

00:22.697 --> 00:26.815
They get a hundred percent of their pay, but do eighty percent of the hours.

00:27.092 --> 00:30.523
What started as a trial is now a permanent switch.

00:30.829 --> 00:36.019
We've seen our happiness go up significantly and we've seen our fatigue come down.

00:36.179 --> 00:41.120
Through the trial, say, we can prove that our team are happier, less tired,...

00:41.492 --> 00:42.534
...and are making more money.

00:43.145 --> 00:43.787
It's pretty cool.

00:44.185 --> 00:44.927
So, how did you do it?

00:45.115 --> 00:46.780
Zero admin, I like to call it.

00:46.867 --> 00:49.241
We're trying to get rid of as much of the admin as possible.

00:49.319 --> 00:52.127
That you didn't need to do, our board meetings,...

00:52.233 --> 00:54.705
...where it used to be two hours long, they're now half an hour.

00:55.233 --> 01:00.958
If you give people this incredible incentive of a whole day of your time a week,...

01:01.503 --> 01:03.774
...they're going to work really hard to become more productive.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.891
Just ask Linda, the office manager.

01:07.359 --> 01:10.044
A day off for me is to get to do the things that I want to do.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.653
Like this, the litter picking.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.613
Doing something back for my community near where I live.

01:15.062 --> 01:18.283
It gives me more time to reflect and be with nature.

01:18.442 --> 01:19.183
Are you happier?

01:19.497 --> 01:20.596
I am much happier.

01:20.753 --> 01:21.251
Healthier?

01:21.361 --> 01:22.902
Healthier, definitely much healthier.

01:23.019 --> 01:25.851
As you can see it gives us a little bit of exercise as well.

01:26.356 --> 01:27.901
Could you ever go back to a five-day week now?

01:27.987 --> 01:29.756
I wouldn't want to, no.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.684
I wouldn't want to, no.

01:32.753 --> 01:36.395
It's something that I think more companies should take on.

01:36.833 --> 01:41.528
The results are in for the 61 firms who took part in this six-month trial.

01:41.947 --> 01:45.914
Thirty-nine percent of employees surveyed said they were less stressed.

01:46.252 --> 01:49.201
There was a sixty-five percent reduction in sick days.

01:49.436 --> 01:53.724
And companies who provided data said, revenue stayed broadly the same.
