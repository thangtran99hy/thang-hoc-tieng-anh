Now, scientists in America say they may have developed a drug...

00:03.398 --> 00:06.183
...for use as a contraceptive pill for men.

00:06.525 --> 00:10.565
They say it works by temporarily stopping sperm from propelling itself.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.822
Now, this drug switches off an enzyme that sperm need...

00:13.900 --> 00:18.559
...to be able to reach an egg to swim and get its way all the way over to an egg.

00:18.643 --> 00:22.923
As you can see there, tests done on mice show that the effect is short-lived.

00:22.999 --> 00:26.145
With normal function restored within 24 hours.

00:26.261 --> 00:27.288
Panic ye not.

00:27.792 --> 00:30.579
For more insight on all of this, let's speak to Stephanie Page,...

00:30.653 --> 00:31.817
...who's an endocrinologist,...

00:31.900 --> 00:35.101
...and professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

00:35.177 --> 00:37.725
Thank you so much for joining me and talking to me about this.

00:37.799 --> 00:38.801
This is really interesting...

00:39.088 --> 00:43.055
...and I know very much within the focus of your research as well,...

00:43.133 --> 00:47.565
...you're involved in the development of a male contraceptive pill...

00:47.653 --> 00:48.727
...also a gel as well.

00:49.004 --> 00:52.965
And how excited, therefore, are you about what you're hearing today?

00:54.431 --> 00:58.049
I think this is really important work, you know, we've been working towards...

00:58.153 --> 01:01.269
...developing a male contraceptive pill for a number of decades now.

01:01.339 --> 01:05.968
And this is really work that's proof of principle that, at least in an animal model,...

01:06.233 --> 01:09.195
...conceptually, an on-demand contraceptive pill...

01:09.407 --> 01:12.501
...could be available to men and women in the future.

01:13.097 --> 01:17.016
Now, this might be a silly question, but I'm asking it because I think it's important.

01:17.298 --> 01:21.927
How sure do you know that what you see in mice is going to be definitely...

01:22.014 --> 01:23.098
...replicated in humans?

01:23.179 --> 01:24.327
Is this going to work for men?

01:25.879 --> 01:29.582
Oh, I think there's quite a bit of work to do to show that, again, this is exciting work.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.181
But we have a long road ahead.

01:31.999 --> 01:35.294
This work shows that, in mice, in a short period of time,...

01:35.369 --> 01:40.974
...given high doses of this block, or so to speak, that this can be effective.

01:41.055 --> 01:44.992
But translating findings in mice and even in non-human,...

01:45.090 --> 01:48.110
...primates to humans has been particularly challenging.

01:48.186 --> 01:50.321
And really in the area of reproductive health,...

01:50.670 --> 01:52.874
...even more challenging than in some other areas.

01:52.944 --> 01:56.017
So, it's really exciting work, but there's quite a lot more to do.
