00:01.548 --> 00:05.332
The war in Ukraine has arguably provoked the most profound change...

00:05.409 --> 00:07.547
...in the world order since World War II.

00:08.204 --> 00:12.373
One in which Vladimir Putin has found himself increasingly isolated.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.561
I'm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted:...

00:16.633 --> 00:17.804
...the Russian economy.

00:18.060 --> 00:22.383
The West responded with a show of unity, both with sanctions on Russia...

00:22.723 --> 00:25.450
...and with billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine.

00:26.098 --> 00:30.296
NATO allies have provided increasing amounts of weapons to Kiev,...

00:30.368 --> 00:33.099
...including rocket launchers, air defense systems...

00:33.260 --> 00:36.165
...and more recently, dozens of combat vehicles.

00:36.795 --> 00:39.773
The joint efforts have led to a renaissance for NATO.

00:40.404 --> 00:44.673
But the war has also caused an economic dilemma for the West.

00:44.927 --> 00:50.733
Overdependence on commodities from authoritarian regimes like Russia...

00:50.900 --> 00:52.413
...makes us vulnerable.

00:52.641 --> 00:55.830
I wish not to repeat that mistake when it comes to China.

00:57.596 --> 01:01.187
The war has brought Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping closer.

01:01.469 --> 01:06.888
China has increased imports of Russian oil, but also sought support over Taiwan.

01:07.645 --> 01:11.085
Russia has also turned to Iran to defy sanctions...

01:11.410 --> 01:16.084
...with a new 25 billion dollar trade route through the Caspian Sea.

01:16.501 --> 01:20.254
Others, like India, have declined to condemn Russian aggression...

01:20.504 --> 01:22.518
...while benefiting from cheaper oil.

01:23.012 --> 01:27.490
Meanwhile, Turkey is playing the mediator role amid deepening economic ties with Russia.

01:27.798 --> 01:32.008
Putin stands firm because he is dominating the political scene.

01:32.087 --> 01:33.560
There is no media freedom.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.403
There is no NGOs.

01:35.522 --> 01:36.871
There is no opposition.

01:37.117 --> 01:40.365
But people feel the effects of Russia's isolation.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.719
As such, the future world order could well be defined by the length of the conflict,...

01:46.999 --> 01:51.256
...as well as Vladimir Putin's support abroad and at home.
