Let's move on to a story about Netflix...

00:03.253 --> 00:07.462
...because the U.S. streaming giant is cutting prices in more than 30 countries...

00:07.643 --> 00:10.044
...as it attempts to attract more subscribers.

00:10.254 --> 00:14.024
It comes as the rise in cost of living, I should say,...

00:14.233 --> 00:18.221
...means that many households are trying to tighten their belts and reduce their outgoings.

00:18.481 --> 00:22.215
Netflix also has lots of other competition from other streaming services.

00:22.288 --> 00:25.831
Well, let's bring in Michelle Fleury, who is in New York for us.

00:26.308 --> 00:29.977
Michelle, whereabouts are they going to cut these prices?

00:30.063 --> 00:34.602
Is it going to make it cheaper for me here in the UK or you there in the U.S.,...

00:34.695 --> 00:36.921
...and why is Netflix doing this?

00:39.489 --> 00:43.011
Look, I think if you're sitting in the United Kingdom, in the U.S, then forget it.

00:43.087 --> 00:44.491
You're not going to get a break in the price,...

00:44.567 --> 00:47.670
...despite the fact that obviously many users in those countries...

00:47.740 --> 00:49.681
...are grappling with the cost of living crisis...

00:49.927 --> 00:53.959
...and are reevaluating whether or not they really need these subscription services.

00:54.032 --> 00:57.517
And we've seen the number of people sort of canceling their subscriptions...

00:57.625 --> 00:58.616
...increase because of that.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.629
I think where Netflix, though, is focusing on cutting the prices...

01:01.704 --> 01:03.850
...in other parts of the world, other parts of Europe,...

01:03.931 --> 01:07.009
...but also in Asia and Latin America, even the Middle East.

01:07.095 --> 01:13.137
We're talking about countries like Indonesia, Venezuela, The United Arab Emirates...

01:13.484 --> 01:17.401
...countries where they may not have such a large user base...

01:17.643 --> 01:22.659
...and where they may not necessarily, also you could consider, you know,...

01:22.743 --> 01:24.869
...are in some cases, lower income countries.

01:25.127 --> 01:28.631
And therefore, people have less disposable income for these kind of services.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.729
So, it's interesting to see,...

01:30.825 --> 01:33.449
...because on the one hand investors have reacted very nervously.

01:33.673 --> 01:38.076
But on the other hand, some analysts are saying look they don't have much to lose...

01:38.164 --> 01:41.560
...given kind of their presence in these markets in some cases...

01:41.649 --> 01:43.030
...where they don't face any competition.
