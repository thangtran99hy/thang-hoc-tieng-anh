00:00.050 --> 00:04.169
Over the past year, the West has unleashed a far-reaching package of sanctions...

00:04.262 --> 00:06.517
...that it hopes will cripple Russia's war machine.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.819
This includes freezing the Russian central bank's access...

00:09.910 --> 00:13.364
...to hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.873
Russian Banks and wealthy individuals have had their assets frozen...

00:17.025 --> 00:19.942
...and trade with the country has been dramatically cut.

00:20.069 --> 00:25.262
The G7 and the EU also recently introduced a price cap on Russian crude oil...

00:25.397 --> 00:30.241
...which it hopes will drive down market prices, squeezing the country's revenues.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.461
Russia's economy has coped fairly well.

00:36.912 --> 00:40.163
The EU delayed its ban on Russian oil exports.

00:40.227 --> 00:44.685
And in the meantime, the country benefited from soaring wholesale energy prices.

00:45.041 --> 00:49.917
Since then, it has successfully diverted much of its trade to China and India.

00:51.489 --> 00:54.727
For people living in Russia, unemployment is at a record low,...

00:54.967 --> 00:56.829
...and wage growth a record high.

00:57.053 --> 01:00.573
That being said, hundreds of thousands of people have left the country.

01:00.907 --> 01:04.957
And this loss of human capital could soon start weighing on economic growth.

01:08.521 --> 01:12.812
Sanctions on Russia have not yet had the effect that many Western leaders hoped.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.343
But things could soon start to change.

01:15.753 --> 01:21.041
Now that the EU and the G7 have introduced their price cap on Russian energy exports,...

01:21.109 --> 01:25.623
...the country's revenues are falling, just as military expenditure is increasing.

01:26.224 --> 01:29.812
It means the country is having to sell Chinese currency reserves...

01:30.075 --> 01:32.103
...in order to stabilize its finances.

01:36.219 --> 01:38.831
2023 will be more challenging for Russia.

01:39.190 --> 01:42.221
The country's energy revenues are starting to fall,...

01:42.649 --> 01:45.693
...but the country has built up a significant cushion...

01:45.787 --> 01:49.257
...that economists believe will allow it to weather the strain of sanctions...

01:49.367 --> 01:50.097
...in the coming year.
