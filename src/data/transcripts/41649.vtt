Death from overwork kills Japan's overstretched workers with heart attacks,...

00:05.403 --> 00:07.605
...strokes from mental stress, malnourishment,...

00:08.072 --> 00:10.613
...and some workers even take their own lives.

00:11.074 --> 00:14.853
A survey by the OECD found Japanese middle school teachers...

00:15.021 --> 00:16.691
...work 56 hours a week,...

00:17.054 --> 00:20.755
...compared to an average 38 hours in most developed countries.

00:21.146 --> 00:24.978
That doesn't account for the massive overtime hours spent cleaning,...

00:25.135 --> 00:29.325
...supervising school commutes to after-school clubs and other tasks.

00:32.887 --> 00:37.700
I have things to do outside school too, including family responsibilities,...

00:38.782 --> 00:42.729
...so I sometimes get snowed under and feel pressured time-wise.

00:44.331 --> 00:48.587
But even when I am under pressure, I don't reduce my workload at school.

00:49.896 --> 00:55.712
I enjoy the time I spend playing with the kids, and I just cannot stop.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.686
An investigation by a union-affiliated think tank...

01:03.021 --> 01:08.086
...showed school teachers work an average 123 hours of overtime each month,...

01:08.635 --> 01:12.480
...pushing their weekly workload well beyond the dangerous 80-hour threshold,...

01:12.829 --> 01:15.223
...which labor experts call the karoshi line.

01:16.017 --> 01:19.137
Teaching is often seen as a sacred job devoted to children,...

01:19.632 --> 01:21.288
...but there are growing calls in Japan...

01:21.757 --> 01:24.403
...for teachers to stop pushing beyond their limits.
