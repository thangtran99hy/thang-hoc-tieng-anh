Thirty minutes outside Gaziantep is the town of Oguzeli.

00:04.658 --> 00:08.113
Its newest occupants are a Japanese medical relief team,...

00:08.517 --> 00:13.317
...which has 70 personnel and a daily caseload of more than 100 patients.

00:13.739 --> 00:18.454
They're all self-sufficient; I bring all the equipment and medicine from Japan...

00:18.961 --> 00:25.831
...to set up by myself and our food and the shelter I have.

00:26.468 --> 00:31.836
Our hospital and our department are all self-sufficient.

00:32.539 --> 00:36.354
Dr. Oba says he's not seeing as many quake trauma cases anymore,...

00:36.586 --> 00:39.979
...but instead a rise in acute and chronic disease patients...

00:40.303 --> 00:43.555
...as overwhelmed and sometimes damaged local hospitals...

00:43.669 --> 00:46.650
...struggle to keep up with their normal appointments.

00:47.324 --> 00:51.145
Many different countries have set up field hospitals here in southern Turkiye.

00:51.437 --> 00:55.983
All are appreciated and necessary, but no two are exactly alike.

00:56.529 --> 01:01.211
Instead, each brings with it its own sense of identity and experience.

01:01.751 --> 01:05.205
In Japan, many earthquakes occur, so last...

01:05.537 --> 01:09.208
...we can remember the big earthquake that occurred in 2011.

01:09.323 --> 01:12.069
At the time, many people, Japanese people, died,...

01:12.652 --> 01:16.334
...so we have a rich experience in how to deal with these kinds of things.

01:16.961 --> 01:18.856
He says since Turkish rescue teams...

01:18.965 --> 01:21.612
...spent so long in Japan during their time of need,...

01:21.858 --> 01:24.410
...it's now Japan's time to help a friend in need...

01:24.730 --> 01:27.761
...and build on a relationship made of shared values.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.751
When we arrived to support Turkish people,...

01:31.420 --> 01:35.529
...many Turkish people welcomed us and they support us.

01:35.859 --> 01:39.919
We are now staying in Oguzeli, and we are staying in a camp.

01:40.363 --> 01:43.451
They try to provide us meals and desserts,...

01:43.888 --> 01:47.045
...say hello, try to study, speak Japanese.

01:47.413 --> 01:49.100
The Japanese medical relief team...

01:49.175 --> 01:52.324
...is expected to remain in Turkiye for another two weeks...

01:52.505 --> 01:55.845
...until the country begins to find its footing once again.

01:56.552 --> 01:59.745
