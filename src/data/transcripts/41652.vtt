00:00.741 --> 00:03.853
Known as "seishain" or "seikishain" in Japanese,...

00:04.099 --> 00:07.907
...this is the one and only regular employment type there is in Japan.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.951
If you are a seishain or seikishain,...

00:11.187 --> 00:13.719
...that means that you have an unlimited contract,...

00:13.879 --> 00:17.427
...but in reality, this means until you reach the age of 60.

00:18.009 --> 00:21.541
If you are a foreigner who wishes to work in Japan for a long time,...

00:21.766 --> 00:24.753
...this type of employment must be included in your visa.

00:25.052 --> 00:28.691
This way, the immigration bureau would know that you are a stable person...

00:28.924 --> 00:32.506
...and is someone who is able to support themselves within the country.

00:33.859 --> 00:38.628
That being said, there are many benefits of working as a seishain here in Japan.

00:39.170 --> 00:43.589
For example, you will be entitled to essential insurance and leave,...

00:43.689 --> 00:47.270
...but there are also other benefits such as bonuses and promotions.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.965
Next, we will talk about non-regular employment.

00:51.156 --> 00:54.464
There are several types of non-regular employment types in Japan...

00:54.639 --> 00:57.053
...and first, we will talk about contractual employment.

00:58.222 --> 01:01.553
Contractual employees are called "keiyakushain" in Japanese...

01:01.778 --> 01:04.874
...and this means that you are working for a limited amount of time.

01:05.286 --> 01:08.979
Contractual employees are generally under the same insurance package...

01:09.123 --> 01:10.383
...as regular employees,...

01:10.470 --> 01:13.229
...but the downside is that there is less job stability.

01:14.573 --> 01:18.087
The span you will be working for will differ depending on the contract...

01:18.248 --> 01:21.435
...and this may be three months, six months or twelve months,...

01:21.631 --> 01:26.511
...but contract breaching is generally a big no-no unless it is an absolute emergency.

01:27.309 --> 01:31.111
A subtype within the contractual employee is "hakenshain."

01:31.381 --> 01:33.795
This means that you are dispatched with a contract...

01:34.074 --> 01:37.443
...from a company to another company where you will be working.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.417
The benefit of being a hakenshain is that once your job ends,...

01:41.559 --> 01:45.117
...there is a higher likelihood that you will be able to find a company...

01:45.209 --> 01:46.781
...which you will be able to work for.

01:47.412 --> 01:51.317
The other type of a non-regular employee is a part-time worker.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.194
We call part-time workers "ayubaito" or "pato" in Japanese.

01:55.432 --> 01:58.121
This means that you will be able to work flexibly...

01:58.213 --> 02:01.423
...and you may work a few hours a day or a few days a week.
