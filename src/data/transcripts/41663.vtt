Sanyukai is a nonprofit, and its goal is to help the homeless...

00:03.201 --> 00:07.183
...and former homeless around the area of Sanya, Tokyo's skid row.

00:07.783 --> 00:09.424
Although as far as skid rows go,...

00:09.582 --> 00:11.941
...I got to say, it's quite orderly and clean.

00:12.748 --> 00:16.635
While Sanyukai only has ten staff, it has over 100 volunteers,...

00:16.823 --> 00:18.859
...which include former homeless people themselves.

00:19.507 --> 00:22.937
Beyond the free healthcare, food and temporary shelter they provide,...

00:23.343 --> 00:25.685
...perhaps the most important aspect of their mission...

00:26.011 --> 00:29.630
...is the personal connection they make with these mostly senior men.

00:30.059 --> 00:32.253
While these men have all found shelter off the streets,...

00:32.409 --> 00:33.845
...it wasn't always like that for them.

00:34.198 --> 00:37.267
It's for that reason that Sanyukai makes meals on a daily basis,...

00:37.502 --> 00:39.724
...where they sometimes serve over 100 people.

00:42.915 --> 00:46.342
Once the meals are made, they take the food to a predetermined location,...

00:46.637 --> 00:50.505
...today, under a highway, where people made up two lines to receive the food.

00:51.691 --> 00:54.972
Everyone got a ticket, and five per line were sent to get their meals.
