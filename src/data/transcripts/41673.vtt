Why are South Korean women having fewer babies?

00:05.900 --> 00:07.822
Well, there are a lot of reasons behind,...

00:07.900 --> 00:10.740
...a lot of reasons behind South Korea's birth rate crisis.

00:11.003 --> 00:15.153
There is sky-high housing prices.

00:15.233 --> 00:19.767
They make it a lot (harder) for a lot of young people to have a place to live...

00:19.949 --> 00:21.903
...and find a place to live together.

00:22.310 --> 00:27.055
Or there's an enormous cost of child rearing that make a lot of young people...

00:27.143 --> 00:30.729
...to give up on the idea of having a child to begin with.

00:31.233 --> 00:37.410
And there is this so long working hours that a lot of, notoriously long working hours...

00:37.493 --> 00:40.727
...that make a lot of young people to think that, rightfully so,...

00:40.821 --> 00:45.517
...that they are having work-life balance is almost impossible to have...

00:45.605 --> 00:50.043
...including having a child and having a career, at the same time.

00:50.391 --> 00:53.729
But there is also a very one important factor behind this crisis...

00:53.808 --> 00:57.690
...is that the gender inequality that is very deeply ingrained...

00:57.763 --> 01:00.214
...in the country's family culture and family life...

01:00.524 --> 01:04.483
...that puts extremely disproportionate burden of child care...

01:04.567 --> 01:07.306
...and domestic responsibility on these women.

01:07.507 --> 01:11.928
And also coupled with the rampant discrimination against women...

01:12.045 --> 01:16.921
...especially married women and working mothers in a lot of South Korean workplaces...

01:16.999 --> 01:23.245
...make a lot of young women to shun the child first and even marriage altogether.
