00:00.433 --> 00:03.122
Now, the U.S House Foreign Affairs Committee...

00:03.191 --> 00:06.250
...has voted to give President Joe Biden new powers...

00:06.317 --> 00:09.735
...for an outright ban of TikTok and other social media apps.

00:10.179 --> 00:14.917
Lawmakers voted 26 to 16 to approve the measure.

00:15.019 --> 00:18.145
Republican committee chair, Michael McCall, sponsored it.

00:18.278 --> 00:20.728
Democrats on the committee opposed the bill.

00:21.263 --> 00:24.405
TikTok is used by more than 100 million Americans.

00:24.505 --> 00:28.394
The measure would need to be passed by the full House and U.S. Senate...

00:28.487 --> 00:30.437
...before it can go to Biden.

00:31.008 --> 00:35.305
TikTok has come under increased scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic...

00:35.551 --> 00:39.595
...as Western countries take a critical look at the Chinese company's reach...

00:40.013 --> 00:42.309
...and the security risks it may pose.

00:42.445 --> 00:44.955
Canada's Electronic Spy Agency, for instance,...

00:45.218 --> 00:48.474
...is now watching for security threats from TikTok.

00:49.921 --> 00:52.851
Canada has banned TikTok from government phones,...

00:53.053 --> 00:57.929
...saying the Chinese app carries an unacceptable risk to privacy and security.

00:58.318 --> 01:02.865
Ottawa will also block federal employees from downloading the app in the future.

01:03.709 --> 01:10.119
We're making the decision that, for government employees, for government equipment...

01:11.016 --> 01:14.049
...it is better to not have them access TikTok...

01:14.219 --> 01:17.583
...because of the concerns that people have in terms of safety.

01:17.849 --> 01:21.302
This may be a first step, it may be the only step we need to take.

01:21.367 --> 01:25.850
But every step of the way, we're going to be making sure we're keeping Canadians safe.

01:26.237 --> 01:31.817
In the U.S., federal agencies have 30 days to remove the Chinese owned video platform...

01:31.972 --> 01:34.191
...from all government-issued devices.

01:34.746 --> 01:38.755
Contractors must comply within 90 days, the White House said on Monday.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.580
The decisions further strain Sino Western relations...

01:42.815 --> 01:44.617
...which have been troubled in recent years.

01:44.743 --> 01:49.823
Most recently over Western accusations that China could use data to threaten cybersecurity.
