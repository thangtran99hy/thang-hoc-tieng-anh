Now, when is Swiss chocolate not Swiss chocolate?

00:03.144 --> 00:05.786
Well, maybe when it's not entirely made in Switzerland.

00:06.461 --> 00:11.345
Toblerone has had to remove the image of the Matterhorn Mountain from its packaging...

00:11.428 --> 00:14.100
...because of strict rules in Switzerland.

00:14.193 --> 00:17.841
It's because it's moving production from Switzerland to Slovakia.

00:18.197 --> 00:23.105
Well, Toblerone say that they will use a more generic mountain image instead.

00:23.326 --> 00:26.623
Well, let's speak to the international branding expert, Alison Stewart Allen.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.207
She's chief executive of International Marketing Partners.

00:29.277 --> 00:31.214
And it's an interesting one, this, isn't it?

00:31.299 --> 00:33.491
Because they've said, look, we're going to move that production.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.175
That's a business decision.

00:35.413 --> 00:38.437
But those strict rules mean it can't call it Swiss chocolate.

00:39.944 --> 00:40.799
That's correct.

00:40.877 --> 00:44.293
And from a branding perspective, this is a bit of a problem,...

00:44.373 --> 00:45.928
...you could say, for Mondelez...

00:45.999 --> 00:51.439
...who have relied on this incredibly successful chocolate around the globe.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.884
This is a brand that everybody knows and everyone associates with Switzerland.

00:57.487 --> 01:02.653
Even the shape of the triangle is meant to mirror the shape of the Matterhorn.

01:03.020 --> 01:05.924
And now, they're going to have to lose the image of the Matterhorn...

01:06.000 --> 01:10.278
...and put a generic mountain of some kind in that iconography.

01:10.945 --> 01:11.987
The challenge though,...

01:12.066 --> 01:16.087
...is that being affiliated with Switzerland brings them great benefit.

01:16.967 --> 01:21.501
And the Swiss brand, if you like, both as a country and the products...

01:21.595 --> 01:23.661
...and services that they create,...

01:24.180 --> 01:28.123
...we all associate these with luxury and with quality.

01:28.517 --> 01:34.337
So, by losing the Swiss affiliation, Mondelez certainly risks us thinking differently,...

01:34.541 --> 01:38.839
...perhaps less highly of this particular brand.
