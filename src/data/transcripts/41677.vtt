00:02.476 --> 00:07.565
My mom is 84 years old and she's at home watching.

00:08.040 --> 00:11.699
Mom, I just won an Oscar.

00:20.919 --> 00:23.326
My journey started on a boat.

00:23.805 --> 00:25.950
I spent a year in a refugee camp...

00:26.587 --> 00:31.663
...and somehow I ended up here on Hollywood's biggest stage.

00:34.829 --> 00:39.409
They say stories like this only happen in the movies.

00:39.775 --> 00:42.185
I cannot believe it's happening to me.

00:42.351 --> 00:45.358
This is the American Dream.

00:52.551 --> 00:54.088
Thank you so much.

00:54.222 --> 00:57.043
Thank you so much to the Academy for this honor of a lifetime.

00:57.343 --> 01:01.263
Thank you to my mom for the sacrifice that she made to get me here.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.761
To my little brother David, who calls me every day,...

01:07.238 --> 01:09.275
...just to remind me to take good care of myself.

01:09.409 --> 01:10.347
I love you, brother.

01:11.383 --> 01:16.277
I owe everything to the love of my life, my wife Echo,...

01:22.014 --> 01:27.775
...who, month after month, year after year, for 20 years,...

01:28.202 --> 01:34.063
...told me that one day my time will come.

01:35.395 --> 01:38.185
Dreams are something you have to believe in.

01:38.585 --> 01:40.979
I almost gave up on mine.

01:41.385 --> 01:44.778
To all of you out there, please keep your dreams alive.
