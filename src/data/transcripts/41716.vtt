I love going to India.

00:05.391 --> 00:09.218
I'm always excited by the great progress the country is making.

00:09.614 --> 00:12.617
More children are surviving and thriving...

00:13.162 --> 00:16.027
...and getting access to improved education.

00:16.541 --> 00:20.320
Millions of families have been lifted out of poverty.

00:21.510 --> 00:25.371
India has a very innovative workforce,...

00:25.720 --> 00:28.656
...resourceful and optimistic about the future.

00:29.141 --> 00:33.716
They're finding ingenious ways to reduce poverty and hunger,...

00:34.533 --> 00:37.567
...improve access to health care, financial services...

00:37.955 --> 00:39.708
...clean water and sanitation.

00:41.291 --> 00:41.989
During my visits,...

00:42.109 --> 00:46.955
...I get to see health workers, teachers, scientists and politicians.

00:47.275 --> 00:51.452
It takes all those different groups to pull these solutions together.

00:52.540 --> 00:56.697
So I love the energy and the learning I get every time I'm there.
