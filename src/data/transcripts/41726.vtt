Every year, Japan marks Coming of Age Day,...

00:02.985 --> 00:07.653
...a national holiday celebrating the entry into adulthood for teenagers turning 20.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.397
But that legal age of adulthood is now dropping to 18.

00:11.567 --> 00:14.353
The first such change in a century and a half.

00:14.655 --> 00:17.697
With an aging population and a declining birth rate,...

00:17.931 --> 00:22.124
...the thinking is it's time to get those teenagers contributing as adults...

00:22.199 --> 00:23.421
...to the economy sooner.

00:23.776 --> 00:26.830
The aging society causes a lot of social problems...

00:26.957 --> 00:30.361
...such as pensions, economic growth and so forth,...

00:30.731 --> 00:36.338
...but we are expecting the younger generation be more active.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.678
But there are fears many young men and women with little financial knowledge...

00:40.900 --> 00:44.086
...could fall into debt or even fall victim to fraud.

00:45.027 --> 00:49.358
While the legal age for drinking, smoking and public gambling will remain at 20.

00:49.524 --> 00:54.319
Other areas that have until now needed parental approval will be dropped to 18.

00:54.567 --> 00:59.601
Such as applying for a credit card or mobile phone contract, renting an apartment,...

00:59.735 --> 01:02.655
...applying for a bank loan or buying stocks.
