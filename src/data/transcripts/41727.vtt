Most people reckon that street art evolved from graffiti,...

00:03.829 --> 00:07.251
...which fun fact has been going on for thousands of years.

00:07.486 --> 00:09.199
Look, ancient graffiti.

00:10.429 --> 00:12.090
That doesn't mean it's good.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.198
In fact, most people would agree that graffiti is a bit of an eyesore.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.933
But street art is another matter.

00:19.735 --> 00:24.014
Over the years, some street artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Harring...

00:24.101 --> 00:27.883
...have become famous for their work, which started on public walls,...

00:30.326 --> 00:34.953
...and then there's this guy, or maybe this guy, or is it this guy?

00:35.185 --> 00:36.083
I dunno.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.755
In fact, no one really knows who Banksy is.

00:39.014 --> 00:40.958
But everyone knows his work.

00:41.680 --> 00:46.297
Banksy started spraying his political-themed pieces in the UK in the 90s.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.755
And since then, his work has appeared around the world.

00:50.072 --> 00:54.077
Attracting thousands of tourists and sometimes selling for a lot.

00:55.407 --> 00:57.939
Although you never know when this is going to happen.
