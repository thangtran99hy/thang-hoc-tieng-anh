Shohei, what does this mean for the people back in Japan?

00:27.747 --> 00:30.882
Japanese baseball, the kids that play baseball in Japan,...

00:30.987 --> 00:33.465
...they always looked up to American baseball, big leagues.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.325
So, this time we were able to win,...

00:36.447 --> 00:38.405
...but not saying we're better than U.S. or anything,...

00:38.492 --> 00:39.985
...but I think we got a little closer,...

00:40.205 --> 00:42.157
...and I think all the people in Japan feel that.

00:42.867 --> 00:45.807
Shohei, how does this moment compare in your career?

00:45.947 --> 00:48.703
Is this the best moment in your career so far?

01:12.042 --> 01:13.404
It's definitely probably number one.

01:13.719 --> 01:14.556
It's got to be up there.

01:14.977 --> 01:17.753
Like you said, it was like a storybook ending, storybook situation.

01:18.039 --> 01:21.271
But more than anything else, I really appreciate this whole tournament,...

01:21.393 --> 01:23.159
...this whole situation, this whole atmosphere.
