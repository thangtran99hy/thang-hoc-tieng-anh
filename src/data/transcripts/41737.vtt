Dear friends, I send my warmest wishes...

00:03.011 --> 00:04.883
...as Muslims around the world begin observing...

00:04.973 --> 00:06.155
...the holy months of Ramadan.

00:07.190 --> 00:09.615
This is a moment of reflection and learning,...

00:10.269 --> 00:11.275
...a time to come together...

00:11.373 --> 00:13.457
...in a spirit of understanding and compassion,...

00:13.972 --> 00:15.608
...bound by our common humanity.

00:16.656 --> 00:18.704
That is also the mission of the United Nations:...

00:18.775 --> 00:21.419
...to foster dialogue, unity and peace.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.097
In these challenging times,...

00:23.180 --> 00:24.943
...my thoughts are with those facing conflict,...

00:25.049 --> 00:26.575
...displacement and suffering.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.206
I join everyone observing Ramadan...

00:29.313 --> 00:31.977
...to call for peace, mutual respect and solidarity.

00:32.757 --> 00:34.981
Let us take inspiration from these holy months...

00:35.314 --> 00:38.421
...and build a more just and equitable world for all.

00:38.828 --> 00:40.231
Ramadan Kareem.
