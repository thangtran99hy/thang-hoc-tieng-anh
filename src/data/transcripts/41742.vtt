The road from Japan to Ukraine...

00:02.702 --> 00:06.196
...for the 82-year-old Dewi Sukarno took several days.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.381
Airplanes do not fly to Kiev from Tokyo now,...

00:09.619 --> 00:13.049
...and yet from the very morning, Dewi is already on her feet.

00:13.252 --> 00:15.195
In Japan, Dewi is a celebrity.

00:15.339 --> 00:18.262
She has her own brand of cosmetics and jewelry.

00:18.477 --> 00:21.494
She arrived in Ukraine with a blue and yellow manicure...

00:21.662 --> 00:25.975
...to show support for Ukraine.

00:26.286 --> 00:28.471
Dewi is in Ukraine for the second time.

00:28.661 --> 00:33.178
In 1962, she came to Kiev as the wife of the president of Indonesia.

00:33.313 --> 00:36.577
She says that now the impressions are completely different.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.953
I have a great memory about Kiev.

00:39.351 --> 00:42.788
We saw beautiful ballet, a beautiful theater,...

00:43.160 --> 00:47.730
...a beautiful cathedral, all the beautiful architecture,...

00:48.039 --> 00:52.542
...and it was so painful for me to see it has been destroyed.

00:53.017 --> 00:55.528
Dewi did not come to Ukraine empty-handed.

00:55.683 --> 00:58.409
She brought, according to her, warmth and light,...

00:58.506 --> 01:00.815
...what Ukrainians need most of all now.

01:01.007 --> 01:05.206
Several suitcases with essentials have already been handed out to people,...

01:05.349 --> 01:06.715
...and four more containers,...

01:06.883 --> 01:09.905
...several tons each, will arrive in Ukraine in a few weeks.
