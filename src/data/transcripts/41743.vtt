I've always been interested in living a sustainable life,...

00:07.425 --> 00:09.758
...but how much impact can just one person make?

00:10.399 --> 00:12.233
I knew real change would only come...

00:12.355 --> 00:15.523
...by providing other people with the means to live more sustainably.

00:16.383 --> 00:19.741
I cofounded Kyoto's first zero-waste supermarket,...

00:20.121 --> 00:22.989
...where you can buy what you need without any plastic packaging.

00:25.487 --> 00:27.103
My name is Mariko McTier.

00:28.033 --> 00:32.411
In 2018, I came across an entire beach covered in single-use PET bottles.

00:33.109 --> 00:36.143
I thought, clean tap water is readily available in Japan...

00:36.405 --> 00:37.953
...if only people used it more often.

00:38.827 --> 00:40.853
This simple idea led to MyMizu,...

00:41.230 --> 00:42.595
...an app that connects users...

00:42.693 --> 00:45.450
...with over 200,000 free water refill points globally.

00:46.106 --> 00:48.239
Our users are constantly adding new locations...

00:48.523 --> 00:50.583
...and participating businesses are growing daily.

00:52.972 --> 00:54.333
There is still so much work ahead,...

00:54.564 --> 00:55.829
...but I believe we can change...

00:55.939 --> 00:59.088
...the way people think about sustainability and their impact on the world.
