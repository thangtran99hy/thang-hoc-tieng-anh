00:00.321 --> 00:03.101
Is there a kill switch, a way to shut the whole thing down?

00:03.319 --> 00:03.947
Yes.

00:04.107 --> 00:06.824
What really happens is, any engineer can just say,...

00:06.889 --> 00:08.328
..."We're going to disable this for now"...

00:08.641 --> 00:10.784
...or "We're going to deploy this new version of the model."

00:10.897 --> 00:11.321
A human.

00:11.402 --> 00:11.674
Yeah.

00:12.033 --> 00:16.339
The model itself, can it take the place of that human?

00:16.483 --> 00:19.479
Could it become more powerful than that human?

00:21.611 --> 00:22.997
So, in the sci-fi movies, yes.

00:23.141 --> 00:25.514
In our world, in the way we're doing things,...

00:25.643 --> 00:28.500
...this model is sitting on a server.

00:29.035 --> 00:30.869
It waits until someone gives it an input.

00:31.685 --> 00:33.557
But you raise an important point,...

00:33.670 --> 00:37.524
...which is the humans who are in control of the machine right now,...

00:37.646 --> 00:39.521
...also have a huge amount of power.

00:39.981 --> 00:43.977
We do worry a lot about authoritarian governments developing this.

00:44.325 --> 00:49.293
Putin has himself said, "Whoever wins this artificial intelligence race...

00:49.579 --> 00:51.691
...is essentially the controller of humankind."

00:51.789 --> 00:52.577
Do you agree with that?

00:52.940 --> 00:54.837
So, that was a chilling statement, for sure.

00:55.086 --> 00:58.325
What I hope instead is that we successively develop...

00:58.605 --> 01:01.964
...more and more powerful systems that we can all use in different ways...

01:02.061 --> 01:05.054
...that get integrated into our daily lives, into the economy,...

01:05.517 --> 01:07.607
...and become an amplifier of human will,...

01:08.013 --> 01:10.125
...but not this autonomous system, that is...

01:10.538 --> 01:12.524
The single controller, essentially god.

01:12.652 --> 01:13.315
Really don't want that.
