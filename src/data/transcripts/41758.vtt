Some say it's impossible ending plastic waste,...

00:08.523 --> 00:13.474
...but to us, that talk is just part of the problem.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.293
Yeah, I said it.

00:16.452 --> 00:16.923
What's up?

00:19.756 --> 00:21.835
This one is for the oceans.

00:25.086 --> 00:27.139
So let's not run away from this challenge.

00:27.557 --> 00:31.670
Let's run towards it because we all have our reasons.

00:32.095 --> 00:37.228
We run for our homes, for our families, for the next generation.

00:37.945 --> 00:42.046
To help put our foot down on plastic waste and stand out for what's right.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.533
It's time to run for the oceans.

00:45.927 --> 00:48.610
And show the ones who have given up while we never will.

00:49.109 --> 00:50.348
Oh my gosh.

00:52.491 --> 00:53.881
Oh my gosh.

00:57.233 --> 00:58.167
Deep breaths brother.

00:58.567 --> 00:59.525
In and out.

00:59.832 --> 01:00.979
Oh my gosh.

01:04.567 --> 01:09.757
We'll do it step by step, minute by minute, bottle by bottle.

01:14.087 --> 01:15.938
You know, maybe they're right.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.067
It might be impossible to do on our own.

01:20.097 --> 01:24.141
But together, impossible is nothing.
