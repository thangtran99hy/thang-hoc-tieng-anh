These fibers are made from old clothes.

00:04.849 --> 00:10.241
It's part of a process that can turn nearly any used fabric into something brand new.

00:12.233 --> 00:15.874
And fashion retailer H&M bets this solution...

00:16.233 --> 00:20.618
...could eventually recycle some of the billions of tons of textile waste...

00:20.735 --> 00:21.806
...produced every year.

00:23.025 --> 00:27.248
But can a fast fashion company solve the problem it helped create?

00:28.135 --> 00:31.099
We went to Hong Kong and Sweden to find out.

00:32.785 --> 00:37.372
Most recycled textiles are turned into mattress stuffing or insulation.

00:39.054 --> 00:44.101
And the original materials are scraps from the factory floor, not used clothing.

00:45.745 --> 00:50.621
But this facility inside a Hong Kong shopping mall is the first in the world...

00:50.724 --> 00:55.035
...to turn used clothes into new clothes all in one place.

00:56.233 --> 01:00.260
First, a technician like Emily Shao examines the garment.

01:00.781 --> 01:03.235
So today we'll recycle old garment.

01:03.896 --> 01:08.049
This ozone chamber sanitizes the fabric in about an hour.

01:09.567 --> 01:13.061
Then Emily removes the buttons, labels, and zippers.

01:13.567 --> 01:16.201
And cuts the garment so the fabric is easy to work with.

01:18.521 --> 01:21.561
The shredder strips the bits of cloth down further.

01:22.763 --> 01:26.083
And then I would take off the open fabrics.

01:27.140 --> 01:30.898
But this part of the process does require some new materials.

01:31.477 --> 01:35.819
So we'll add some virgin fibers into the yarns to make the stronger.

01:37.050 --> 01:40.479
Another machine mixes that cotton with the recycled skirt.

01:43.453 --> 01:46.487
Emily then rolls the mixed fibers into clumps...

01:47.954 --> 01:52.073
...and feeds them into a machine that turns them into what's called a fiber web.

01:55.745 --> 02:00.893
But what happens next makes the assembly line in Hong Kong, the first of its kind.

02:01.751 --> 02:06.458
The fiber web gets bundled into these snake-like slivers.

02:08.171 --> 02:13.810
The slivers are then spun into ply yarn, the building blocks of a new garment.

02:16.003 --> 02:20.275
Finally, a machine knits a new sweater based on a computer design.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.733
Shoppers pay about $65 to recycle clothing here.
