The past has come back to haunt these protesters in the South Korean capital, Seoul.

00:10.900 --> 00:14.388
"We condemn the government", says this protesting relative.

00:14.712 --> 00:17.296
The remaining link to many long dead victims...

00:17.455 --> 00:21.027
...of Japan's bloody occupation of the Korean Peninsula.

00:21.754 --> 00:25.727
They're demanding direct compensation from Japanese companies...

00:26.093 --> 00:28.219
...and a fresh apology from Tokyo.

00:31.794 --> 00:36.253
Japan normalized ties with South Korea in 1965...

00:36.600 --> 00:41.989
...after Japanese companies apologized for enslaving hundreds of thousands of Koreans...

00:42.185 --> 00:46.823
...during Tokyo's brutal 35 year colonial rule.

00:49.752 --> 00:54.764
Over the years, Japanese companies compensated an estimated 800 million dollars...

00:55.025 --> 00:57.925
...or 7.2 billion dollars in today's money,...

00:58.209 --> 01:00.707
...which Seoul diverted to development projects...

01:00.809 --> 01:05.623
...carried out by major South Korean companies that would transform the country...

01:05.873 --> 01:08.750
...into a tech hub over two decades.

01:09.567 --> 01:12.990
But the Tokyo Seoul deals soured in 2018,...

01:13.274 --> 01:17.431
...when South Korea's Supreme Court ordered two Japanese companies,...

01:17.613 --> 01:21.233
...Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries...

01:21.459 --> 01:25.787
...to compensate former Korean forced laborers or their relatives...

01:25.979 --> 01:28.505
...in violation of the 1965 agreement,...

01:28.973 --> 01:33.233
...leading to a new economic and political standoff with Japan.

01:33.781 --> 01:38.775
Which prime minister Yoon has now resolved with his government's announcement.

01:41.775 --> 01:44.517
Japanese foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi,...

01:44.745 --> 01:50.787
...says Tokyo appreciates the South Korean announcement as a step to restore ties.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.036
But Japan still maintains that the South Korean announcement...

01:54.303 --> 01:58.369
...does not require contributions from Japanese companies.

01:59.475 --> 02:03.900
That position angers South Koreans still connected to a past...

02:04.179 --> 02:08.063
...from where most survivors are dead or dying.
