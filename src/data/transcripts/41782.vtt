The U.S. President Joe Biden has welcomed the arrest warrant...

00:02.763 --> 00:06.691
...issued against Vladimir Putin by the International Criminal Court on Friday.

00:07.177 --> 00:09.317
Russia's president is accused of war crimes...

00:09.397 --> 00:13.166
...focusing on the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.

00:13.691 --> 00:15.667
It's the first time the court has ordered the arrest...

00:15.733 --> 00:17.898
...of a prominent serving political leader.

00:18.369 --> 00:22.381
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the decision as historic.

00:22.815 --> 00:25.309
Moscow, they dismissed the announcement as outrageous...

00:25.379 --> 00:28.035
...saying it doesn't recognize the jurisdiction of the court.

00:28.375 --> 00:30.187
Here is BBC's Helena Wilkinson.

00:34.123 --> 00:36.225
It's a war that he ordered.

00:36.641 --> 00:39.471
A war that brought death and devastation.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.399
A war that sent millions fleeing for their lives.

00:43.900 --> 00:48.439
But it's one that has now left President Putin accused of war crimes...

00:48.761 --> 00:54.328
...by an international court and even more isolated on the world stage.

00:54.824 --> 01:00.533
The judges have reviewed the information and evidence submitted by the prosecutor...

01:00.900 --> 01:05.132
...and determined that there are credible allegations...

01:05.233 --> 01:08.657
...against these persons for the alleged crimes.

01:09.108 --> 01:14.187
The International Criminal Court based in the Hague, alleges the Russian leader...

01:14.281 --> 01:17.647
...and another official are individually responsible...

01:17.747 --> 01:23.139
...for the war crime of unlawfully deporting children from Ukraine to Russia.

01:23.567 --> 01:28.002
This was the reaction from President Biden to the ICC's move.

01:28.387 --> 01:29.727
Well I think it's justified,...

01:29.810 --> 01:34.203
...but the question is, it is not recognized internationally by us either.

01:34.533 --> 01:36.935
But I think it makes a very strong point.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.175
He's clearly committed war crimes.
