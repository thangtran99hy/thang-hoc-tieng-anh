00:00.050 --> 00:02.937
In the skies near Japan, F-15s on the hunt...

00:03.092 --> 00:06.347
...for a suspected North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile...

00:06.711 --> 00:09.883
...capturing what could be its last seconds in flight.

00:10.443 --> 00:13.183
This rare video released by Japan's military,...

00:13.567 --> 00:17.201
...experts say the burning object resembles a ballistic missile...

00:17.356 --> 00:19.603
...boost rocket re-entering the atmosphere,...

00:19.971 --> 00:22.919
...flying for about an hour at hypersonic speeds.

00:23.281 --> 00:27.296
If there's no interception or the interception fails,...

00:28.783 --> 00:35.651
...an ICBM launched, from North Korea would take a little bit more than 30 minutes...

00:35.763 --> 00:37.797
...to reach the homeland U.S...

00:37.874 --> 00:41.969
...and also depending on if it's the west coast or east coast...

00:42.081 --> 00:43.780
...east coast will take slightly more time.

00:44.174 --> 00:47.566
Chinese scientists simulated a North Korean nuclear attack.

00:47.745 --> 00:49.517
According to the South China Morning Post,...

00:49.716 --> 00:55.287
...the simulation shows 33 minutes from the time of launch to the time of impact...

00:55.531 --> 00:59.037
...if U.S. missile defenses fail to shoot down the ICBM.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.501
Missile defense begins here.

01:01.802 --> 01:04.877
For years, U.S. leaders have reassured the public.

01:04.979 --> 01:07.326
The nation should be very confident.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.887
And America's allies.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.301
Easily shoot them out of the sky.

01:11.453 --> 01:13.859
Missile defense systems can keep them safe.

01:14.516 --> 01:19.142
But virtually all ballistics missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound.

01:19.281 --> 01:20.192
Sometimes faster.

01:20.467 --> 01:22.850
It's been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.308
Trying to hit a warhead.

01:26.129 --> 01:29.857
Three, two, one, ignition.

01:30.385 --> 01:33.662
A report last year finding America's missile defense system,...

01:33.991 --> 01:36.814
...the nation's best, perhaps only line of defense...

01:37.141 --> 01:39.671
...only succeeds about half the time.
