Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

00:02.726 --> 00:08.636
We have decided to discontinue the approach into Singapore Changi Airport...

00:09.304 --> 00:11.514
...and this was because I was informed...

00:12.202 --> 00:14.292
...that we still have got passengers...

00:14.395 --> 00:17.741
...who are not seated with your seatbelts securely fastened,...

00:18.128 --> 00:24.947
...and we are legally not able to land an aircraft if the cabin isn't secure.

00:25.430 --> 00:28.317
We are now turning around again for another approach,...

00:28.407 --> 00:34.805
...and if we have to do another missed approach for the same reason,...

00:34.948 --> 00:41.811
...the airport police will be involved and they will take the necessary action.
